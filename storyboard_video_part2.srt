1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:10,320
Let's talk about composition. So here in this example I'm showing some basic
compositions

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:19,679
and actually there's no wrong or right. These are just guides that can help you.
So most of the time

3
00:00:19,682 --> 00:00:29,520
I'm trying to avoid the middle. So the middle on vertical or horizontal or both
or diagonal.

4
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:38,960
And some movie makers do use this on purpose for the whole movie. It's their
style of filming.

5
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,520
But normally you would see these kinds of compositions because this makes
more...

6
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:55,039
Yeah, it's more out of balance and feels more organic. So this feels more
natural and this

7
00:00:55,042 --> 00:00:58,640
feels a bit more... Yeah.

8
00:00:59,104 --> 00:01:03,373
made or artificial. So when I'm drawing, I try to stick to these kind of
compositions.

9
00:01:03,375 --> 00:01:04,567

We compress knowledge for you!

10
00:01:06,624 --> 00:01:14,304
So when I start with a drawing or a storyboard and I want to make a story about
a house,

11
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:21,183
I decide on which point I want to start making that. So most of the time, that's
why I make

12
00:01:21,186 --> 00:01:28,144
this nine sliced apart. So I decide I'm going to draw the house here.

13
00:01:30,304 --> 00:01:38,463
And here's the horizon line. And maybe here's a character. So now it's, we have
here this

14
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:47,503
character and here this house. And we're avoiding the middle. And our eye gets

15
00:01:47,506 --> 00:01:58,544
um, yeah, attracted to one of these points, but as well in special cases, you
can use this.

16
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:04,208
Try to watch movies and try to see if you can find these compositions.

17
00:02:07,408 --> 00:02:17,647
So in this example, I'm basically doing the same, but then with all these
abstract shapes.

18
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:27,567
So here, let me draw this frame here. And for example, here we have the most
simplest with

19
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:36,848
the ball. So here we have a big ball and here's small one. So this creates
contrast.

20
00:02:38,448 --> 00:02:43,888
And you can also use that for, uh, for example, here making all these shapes

21
00:02:45,168 --> 00:02:57,088
think of a city or something. So here, and here's the horizon line a bit under
the middle.

22
00:02:57,568 --> 00:02:57,648
Okay.

23
00:02:57,888 --> 00:03:03,967
But this creates this out of balance look. And maybe if you watch it modern art,

24
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:07,968
that's basically this. So you, but they are doing a modern arts.

25
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:16,368
That is basically all about composition, creating contrast and interesting
things to, to watch.

26
00:03:18,768 --> 00:03:23,727
So here, so here we have the shapes going this way. And on the other side,

27
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:29,167
we make a small one that makes this, and you can actually use this to create
your,

28
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:34,048
your own art. For example, here, if we have this drawing, then you can draw,
start drawing

29
00:03:34,688 --> 00:03:43,088
on top of it to make an interesting tree out. And here's some small, some small
trees,

30
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,527
for example, and then you can hear even draw a character.

31
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,268
So,

32
00:03:53,440 --> 00:04:00,479
Yeah, that is how you can think of finding interesting compositions.

33
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:09,919
What you could do is take your sketchbook and try to make your own crazy
compositions

34
00:04:09,922 --> 00:04:12,319
with these things.

35
00:04:12,322 --> 00:04:15,839
So here I'm saying distribution of masses.

36
00:04:15,842 --> 00:04:17,919
So here these things are masses.

37
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:21,279
So here's a lot of mass and here not.

38
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:22,679
Balance of shape.

39
00:04:22,682 --> 00:04:27,959
So here we have one big shape and here we have three smaller shapes.

40
00:04:27,962 --> 00:04:28,959
Rhythm.

41
00:04:28,962 --> 00:04:34,839
So here you're trying to get this flow into it.

42
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:39,279
So the best way to practice this is just by doing it.

43
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:42,179
Maybe make variations of what I'm showing here.

44
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:51,199
Try to see what happens if you play around with all those different shapes.

45
00:04:51,202 --> 00:04:52,800
Here I'm showing rhythms.

46
00:04:54,208 --> 00:05:01,887
So this could be useful if you want to make and get attention to something.

47
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:07,887
So for example, here we have this rhythm here and it's almost symmetrical.

48
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:13,647
So it's all out of balance and it creates tension and interesting.

49
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,367
And it feels like there's something moving.

50
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,448
For example, if we would draw a shot here.

51
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,808
And here we have these shapes going to this point.

52
00:05:25,168 --> 00:05:26,848
And then we have this character here.

53
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:39,167
And then this character feels like he's being attacked or something.

54
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:46,287
And you could, for example, I'm going to do this with this shape here.

55
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:53,328
And then here, we could actually do this by maybe this is a river.

56
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:59,008
And this is a bridge, and maybe here's a tree.

57
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:02,767
And we can fix this with the correct perspective.

58
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,848
But this creates this interesting lines.

59
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:14,367
So try to think about rhythm in your drawing.

60
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,887
And this is also a great tool about guiding our eyes,

61
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:22,528
because we're following with our eyes these shapes.

62
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:28,047
So the golden ratio.

63
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:35,328
So this is actually the mathematical formula of the golden ratio.

64
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:47,407
And I don't literally use this formula, but I find it really interesting to use.

65
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:53,248
So what it means is basically this one, this six,

66
00:06:53,616 --> 00:07:01,575
one, eight. And that means that this height is six, one, eight pixels. And this
side is

67
00:07:01,578 --> 00:07:14,055
thousand pixels. Then if we divide here, this thousands and we get off this 618,
then we

68
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:20,135
are left with this place and then you get this shot. So that's, and that's where
the

69
00:07:20,138 --> 00:07:31,135
the rule. So here, that's where the rule of thirds come from. So it's almost
this.

70
00:07:31,138 --> 00:07:40,415
It's a little bit different here. You can see, but this is the, maybe the lazy
way of

71
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:52,895
the golden ratio. And you can totally do this by hand. I don't use these exact
formulas.

72
00:07:52,898 --> 00:07:54,535
And you could guess it.

73
00:07:54,538 --> 00:07:58,976
So then we have this here and then you can divide this shape again.

74
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,816
And then you can divide this shape.

75
00:08:02,616 --> 00:08:04,256
Then you can divide this shape.

76
00:08:04,976 --> 00:08:09,256
Then you can divide this here and this here and this here.

77
00:08:09,496 --> 00:08:15,296
So what we now can do is we can take this line and draw this line

78
00:08:15,776 --> 00:08:19,056
through it, something like this here.

79
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:20,575
And that's the golden ratio.

80
00:08:20,578 --> 00:08:24,376
And you see this and the cool thing is the shape.

81
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:28,416
You see this shape in nature, uh, the snail house.

82
00:08:29,136 --> 00:08:36,055
And for some reason, our, we find it's a pleasant thing to look at and it

83
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:43,016
helps guiding our eyes to, um, so here I'm using it loosely.

84
00:08:43,096 --> 00:08:47,935
You can put this character on this line and then this gun here and here, this

85
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:51,295
thing, and then you get this, our eye.

86
00:08:51,298 --> 00:08:58,656
can go through it. You can even, how to make this even better is maybe use that
there's a hill there

87
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:09,295
and so something like this. So we're getting more into the flow of line and
don't try to

88
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:16,175
use it too rigid, but try to use it loosely like showing here. Here we have this
tree

89
00:09:16,178 --> 00:09:23,136
that's touching this edge and then it ends here and here is the most detail.

90
00:09:24,656 --> 00:09:32,416
So it's just a guide to help you, but actually if you're watching a lot of
movies you can see it's

91
00:09:34,016 --> 00:09:42,016
they use the rule of thirds and the rule of thirds is that you're defined this
in nine.

92
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:47,936
So that's basically a simplified version of the Gonerule and you'll also see
this

93
00:09:49,056 --> 00:09:50,816
being used in movies as well.

94
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:58,368
Maybe a lot of times it's unintentionally or unconscious, but it's behind a lot
of art.

95
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:03,321

We compress knowledge for you!

96
00:10:03,322 --> 00:10:08,927
Clouds, so I was earlier talking about the written and about guiding the eye
with shapes

97
00:10:08,930 --> 00:10:18,767
and with clouds you can perfectly use this to guide the eye or to frame your
character.

98
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:24,208
So what it means to frame your character is that you're using this cloud around
your character

99
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:32,367
and that makes your character stands out. So here this is also this diagonal
direction that

100
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:38,528
also helps makes yeah this tension that's more interesting that they're all
horizontal.

101
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:47,567
Here I'm using the clouds to frame the character but I'm also using the clouds
to point

102
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:50,208
at the character.

103
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,240
And here I saw always trying to get this nice flow

104
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,039
in your cloud shapes here as well,

105
00:11:00,042 --> 00:11:02,200
going around the mountain.

106
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,519
So clouds are great to guide the eye

107
00:11:08,522 --> 00:11:11,319
and to create interesting composition.

108
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:14,640
Think of that abstract shapes with the rhythm shown.

109
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,840
So for shortening,

110
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:24,520
I try to use foreshortening to create depth.

111
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:30,600
For example, if we're drawing an environment,

112
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,880
what you want to avoid is that you don't have any depth

113
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,319
in it.

114
00:11:43,322 --> 00:11:48,319
For example, here we have this tree, branch

115
00:11:48,322 --> 00:11:49,999
and then there's this.

116
00:11:50,002 --> 00:11:52,120
This flower here on the ground.

117
00:11:53,560 --> 00:12:02,880
Now, I think it's more interesting if we make it more, um, maybe there's this

118
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,519
road and then here it is.

119
00:12:06,522 --> 00:12:11,840
Your roads starts really broad and gets too narrow.

120
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,279
So then we get this depth and also this tree branch.

121
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:30,400
It goes into the depth and here this flower is also more like this.

122
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:43,639
So then you have more of, uh, this feeling then instead of this and this, so
you're

123
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:48,440
using this, um, and try to think of it that if you have 3d.

124
00:12:48,576 --> 00:13:03,216
So here this drawing has this, these angles, but this drawing has also the z, x,
um, z, s,

125
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:14,976
or x, I think it was x, so, and I think, I don't know out of my head,

126
00:13:15,696 --> 00:13:22,256
I think this is I, and this is x, but I could be wrong, but don't forget the z,
x.

127
00:13:23,456 --> 00:13:30,255
So try to create depth with these for shortening things. And the most easy way
to, to draw for

128
00:13:30,258 --> 00:13:38,495
shortening is to use these kind of, uh, the, these kind of cylinders to first
draw it.

129
00:13:38,498 --> 00:13:49,216
And then later you, you erase them and then you can draw the, the shapes inside
it.

130
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:54,050
So try to think of it, also with this flower that you're,

131
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,709
so here we're looking a bit on the side of these petals

132
00:14:00,712 --> 00:14:02,689
and here more onwards then.

133
00:14:02,692 --> 00:14:05,050
So we're getting more of this depth.

134
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:10,269
So you can also think of it as sheet of paper.

135
00:14:10,272 --> 00:14:13,649
So here it is from the front, this from the sides,

136
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:16,969
but it's more interesting if we're showing

137
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:19,489
this sheet of paper like this,

138
00:14:19,492 --> 00:14:24,490
that we're seeing a bit of the back,

139
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:27,930
a bit of the front, that creates depth.

140
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:35,849
And this can be a stylistic choice.

141
00:14:35,852 --> 00:14:39,369
I'm not saying that this is always wrong,

142
00:14:39,372 --> 00:14:42,169
but I like to draw more in this style.

143
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:46,329
It's a little bit more realistically.

144
00:14:46,332 --> 00:14:47,170
So.

145
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:53,008
For example, with the clouds, I'm using a big shape versus a small shape,

146
00:14:53,648 --> 00:15:00,368
and then an even bigger shape. And then again, so I'm trying to play around with

147
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:10,368
getting this nice play with big shape, small shape, medium, et cetera, to create

148
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:17,088
contrast in your shapes. For example, also, this is more like graphic or an
icon.

149
00:15:17,488 --> 00:15:24,768
You see this in 2D TV shows. Within animation, feature animation, you often see
this more.

150
00:15:25,568 --> 00:15:32,208
Unless it's really stylistic. Stylistic shows go more to this. But really, if
you're storyboarding,

151
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:38,767
it doesn't even matter that much because it's all about the story. But

152
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:45,808
I do use these kind of shapes more, even when I'm

153
00:15:46,384 --> 00:15:55,223
I'm storyboarding. So basically using a big shape versus a medium shape for

154
00:15:55,226 --> 00:16:03,383
small shape and favorably using middle, big shape, small shape. So it's so watch

155
00:16:03,386 --> 00:16:11,503
out that you're not, if you're drawing a snowman for example, this is dull that

156
00:16:11,506 --> 00:16:18,343
all these shapes are even size. But you want to use contrast of small shape,

157
00:16:18,346 --> 00:16:24,703
bigger, biggest. But maybe this is even more interesting. Middle, small, big. So
you

158
00:16:24,706 --> 00:16:31,263
are having more random, especially when you're working with nature or organic

159
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:37,183
shapes. You can also use this in your your effect. So when you're drawing

160
00:16:37,186 --> 00:16:46,255
effects, if you draw an explosion, don't draw the explosion symmetrical like
this.

161
00:16:46,258 --> 00:16:52,336
Let's try to draw it more here, playing around with those.

162
00:16:55,376 --> 00:16:56,975
I think this is even too symmetrical.

163
00:16:56,978 --> 00:17:03,456
So it's really natural for our humans to draw things really symmetrical.

164
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:12,496
Yeah, maybe this needs to be a big shape.

165
00:17:13,136 --> 00:17:20,495
It can be really hard sometimes to do this correctly.

166
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:28,016
So maybe making this here, this here.

167
00:17:32,496 --> 00:17:36,895
So try to play around here.

168
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:38,095
For example, here is this.

169
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,895
Here, this is all parallel, these lines.

170
00:17:40,898 --> 00:17:46,256
And here I'm playing a bit around with getting more or in even shapes.

171
00:17:46,288 --> 00:17:55,328
Also with water. So try to think about how you can make these organic shapes and
it's all about using

172
00:17:58,768 --> 00:18:05,488
so you can show that here so this is parallel but you can also use this

173
00:18:08,048 --> 00:18:12,047
or you can do this but you can also do this

174
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:20,208
or you can do a straight one against this or if it's a really busy line

175
00:18:22,688 --> 00:18:28,928
you could do complex versus simple and so on

176
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:39,567
a rule of thirds so basically this is a little bit like this golden ratio but
then really simplified

177
00:18:39,570 --> 00:18:44,928
and you can also use this then when you have this

178
00:18:45,488 --> 00:18:51,847
draw these lines to it and then you can draw things along these lines. So let me

179
00:18:51,850 --> 00:19:00,287
show that with this example I'm giving here. So here first draw this shape and

180
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:15,407
then you divide it through nine parts, taking different color. So let's draw the

181
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:20,807
horizon line here so it can be a bit above or a bit under this line and you

182
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:28,807
can also put it here but don't put it here. So here and then we're drawing three

183
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:43,167
here against this line here and here here. So if we're using this line that's

184
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,640
going

185
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,560
through these parts.

186
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,279
How we can use that in this composition is for example here

187
00:19:53,282 --> 00:20:00,640
drawing this tree against this line and here we have this bush here

188
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:08,159
and then here in the distance we have this shape here

189
00:20:08,162 --> 00:20:12,720
and then here within the mountain.

190
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,999
So you're really trying to use this really loosely.

191
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:26,880
We can even and I personally never use that but some people do is making these
lines

192
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:36,560
adding these lines also and then you can use this for drawing these shapes for
example here and there.

193
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:44,320
So again these are just guides that you can use.

194
00:20:44,896 --> 00:20:52,336
And another one that I find really interesting and you don't hear a lot about it
is your path.

195
00:20:52,896 --> 00:20:54,656
So here if we have this shot

196
00:20:57,376 --> 00:21:06,256
and we're making a square in it for example here like this and then here

197
00:21:08,336 --> 00:21:11,936
and then also on the other side and I think it's not used

198
00:21:12,656 --> 00:21:18,735
this more a lot because with these white screens it works less better than with
our old TVs

199
00:21:18,738 --> 00:21:21,696
that weren't this broad it's more like this.

200
00:21:23,776 --> 00:21:31,856
But now our phones and stuff and our screens are so broad that this

201
00:21:32,816 --> 00:21:36,895
works less better because you want to have this that this green box is here

202
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:44,336
and it's purplish here and you don't want them to have like this.

203
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,040
because then you would also have this middle and that almost happens when you're
using

204
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:55,199
cinema screens with this technique. But the interesting thing about this area is
that you

205
00:21:55,202 --> 00:22:05,999
then yeah here you can use this these points also for interesting and for
example here

206
00:22:06,002 --> 00:22:19,519
then you can decide to put the wall line here and so for example the ceiling is
then here and the

207
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:31,919
floor is here and then you can even draw this character here standing and maybe
there's a door

208
00:22:31,922 --> 00:22:41,520
here. So again not too symmetrical so that's maybe we can choose to make this
character.

209
00:22:44,074 --> 00:22:47,354
Even bigger so that we're seeing it in the front here

210
00:22:47,914 --> 00:22:51,994
So so you can use these as guides to to create all these

211
00:22:55,994 --> 00:22:57,994
All these compositions

212
00:22:58,874 --> 00:23:02,794
I find this one really interesting. I don't use it that much because it's

213
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:09,194
I have the feeling it works more with all those old tv screens than with the new
ones

214
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:12,794
So I like to use this one because it's fast and easy

215
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:16,234
Or actually this one I use the most

216
00:23:20,714 --> 00:23:24,574
So a good way to practice this is by watching movies

217
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:31,354
And make studies so when you're uh watching a movie

218
00:23:32,714 --> 00:23:35,194
Pause the the movie

219
00:23:36,954 --> 00:23:40,094
And for example, then we're seeing these two characters

220
00:23:42,202 --> 00:23:47,202
Looking down, and this one is looking here.

221
00:23:49,622 --> 00:23:51,921
So try to think about what kind of composition

222
00:23:51,924 --> 00:23:54,241
does here and does fits with this one.

223
00:23:54,244 --> 00:23:57,362
So if I'm defining it through nine,

224
00:23:58,382 --> 00:24:01,241
then you can see, yeah, now I did a bit wrong,

225
00:24:01,244 --> 00:24:04,041
but you can see that this character's on this line

226
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:06,421
and this other character is on this line.

227
00:24:06,424 --> 00:24:08,521
This character is a little bit higher

228
00:24:08,524 --> 00:24:10,562
and this one is a bit lower.

229
00:24:10,602 --> 00:24:12,922
So what they try to do is

230
00:24:17,362 --> 00:24:20,121
putting a head here and a head here.

231
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:22,801
And what I said, you don't have to put it

232
00:24:22,804 --> 00:24:25,522
exactly on these points

233
00:24:26,802 --> 00:24:30,161
because then not every shot would look the same.

234
00:24:30,164 --> 00:24:31,981
But it's a guide.

235
00:24:31,984 --> 00:24:33,681
Here it is also interesting.

236
00:24:33,684 --> 00:24:36,761
So I was talking about to avoid these things,

237
00:24:36,764 --> 00:24:40,304
but here you can see how a movie director is using this.

238
00:24:40,384 --> 00:24:46,304
to create this symmetrical feeling. And I think it's because there's this

239
00:24:47,744 --> 00:24:57,744
kind of, maybe there's this harmony, almost like the yin-yang sign.

240
00:24:59,984 --> 00:25:06,224
Also here, sometimes it can help to create these triangles. So we're seeing this

241
00:25:07,184 --> 00:25:12,704
character is looking at this character and this character is looking, actually
is looking here.

242
00:25:13,424 --> 00:25:20,783
Does it force our eyes to this point? And this moves again up. So you need to

243
00:25:20,786 --> 00:25:28,703
take a little bit freedom in it. And yeah, again, it's just these signs,

244
00:25:28,706 --> 00:25:34,863
but you can actually see the shapes in when you're watching movies. For example,

245
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:39,664
this shot, there's this total out of balance. Here's

246
00:25:40,016 --> 00:25:46,496
everything that's happening here, but not here. So there's this balance. And you
can see that

247
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:51,696
this movie maker will probably use that in other shots as well.

248
00:25:52,816 --> 00:25:57,536
It's their signature in the movie. So again, here it is a golden ratio.

249
00:25:59,696 --> 00:26:05,855
And maybe you can also find other compositions. But it's really interesting to
look at how they

250
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:17,295
used balance to create these kinds of shots. These are also some interesting
things you can

251
00:26:17,298 --> 00:26:25,695
use to get the attention. So here, I sometimes use that. So when you're
boarding, so for example,

252
00:26:25,698 --> 00:26:37,696
we're drawing this frame here. And we're having this character here.

253
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,600
And then let's take this bit of a gray color.

254
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:49,280
Here we have all these shapes in the foreground.

255
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:58,880
But we're using this camera

256
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,519
where the foreground should be out of focus. How we could do this?

257
00:27:05,522 --> 00:27:12,960
Filter, Blur, and then go to Gaussian Blur. Yeah. And we can make this out of
focus.

258
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:22,960
However, how much you want. And then you get this really attention on this
character.

259
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,039
It's also interesting to use, to play around a bit with this viewer. So that
you're maybe in

260
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:37,600
the shot, you first see these two bunnies.

261
00:27:37,872 --> 00:27:46,351
sitting here, and then we're seeing this character coming out of the, behind the
horizon.

262
00:27:46,354 --> 00:27:50,991
And then because you have this size difference, it creates this interesting, and
you can play

263
00:27:50,994 --> 00:28:00,911
around with, with those things to make interesting shots. Depth. So, atmospheric
perspective,

264
00:28:00,914 --> 00:28:06,992
is this called? So things in the distance are looking more fogged out because of
the

265
00:28:07,872 --> 00:28:12,991
stuff that is in the air. So things that are more in the distance are more
grayed out. So

266
00:28:12,994 --> 00:28:21,391
this is really black, and this is more grayed out. Framing. So again, I think
I've said this before,

267
00:28:21,394 --> 00:28:27,391
but you can use objects to create this frame around the character to make it
really stand out.

268
00:28:27,394 --> 00:28:36,112
Uh, open space. So this feels really like empty. So this is interesting,
establishing shots.

269
00:28:36,272 --> 00:28:42,911
You're seeing, oh, he's alone. He's, he's walking. Maybe he has a goal. Maybe
he's not.

270
00:28:42,914 --> 00:28:50,112
It feels like he's walking with these. He, yeah, maybe he's trying to survive or
something.

271
00:28:53,312 --> 00:29:00,111
Yeah. Water to show the reflection. So this is effect shots to make it extra
special.

272
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:11,951
So the rule of thirds, so you can actually start, maybe you have a script and
then you,

273
00:29:11,954 --> 00:29:20,871
you start with drawing the, the shots with these, if I didn't know, and then you
have,

274
00:29:20,874 --> 00:29:28,711
and you know that these are the focus points and that you want to tell a story
with that.

275
00:29:28,714 --> 00:29:35,752
So maybe you are telling a story about two characters talking to each other.

276
00:29:36,992 --> 00:29:42,991
which character is important and which which character is feeling weaker.

277
00:29:42,994 --> 00:29:48,752
So here we maybe have this strong or maybe here it is this teacher

278
00:29:49,632 --> 00:29:53,872
that is bigger or something and here we have this kid listening.

279
00:29:54,672 --> 00:29:58,832
So then you you create this contrast between these characters and then I'm using
these

280
00:29:59,792 --> 00:30:06,112
these points. But you can start with using these abstract points to to imagine

281
00:30:07,392 --> 00:30:11,552
what you want to tell and how you want to use the composition to tell.

282
00:30:12,272 --> 00:30:16,671
So here I'm showing some things and you can use perspective.

283
00:30:16,674 --> 00:30:20,912
So this is a vanishing point and here we have these perspective points

284
00:30:21,872 --> 00:30:26,751
aiming at this point. So this point gets really the attention.

285
00:30:26,754 --> 00:30:29,231
So here for example here you can use this here.

286
00:30:29,234 --> 00:30:35,872
So because if we would draw maybe there's a big sign sign here.

287
00:30:36,608 --> 00:30:40,208
So these lines are pointing to this character.

288
00:30:43,248 --> 00:30:51,648
Maybe there's a road here, so this road is aiming at this character.

289
00:30:53,248 --> 00:30:59,808
Eyes on one third, I'm using that a lot, what I just shown in the previous
image.

290
00:31:00,688 --> 00:31:03,808
Uh, or here creating this internship.

291
00:31:03,968 --> 00:31:09,167
So here you can see the most basic, uh, compositions, but for storyboarding

292
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:13,408
where you need to draw really fast, this is really, uh, useful.

293
00:31:16,528 --> 00:31:23,488
So drawing backgrounds, um, yeah, basically the same starting with this,

294
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:24,767
this shot.

295
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,488
So that's many, let me take a sketch brush.

296
00:31:28,528 --> 00:31:31,248
So if this one, um,

297
00:31:31,424 --> 00:31:36,064
putting the horizon line on one here and then drawing the house here,

298
00:31:36,864 --> 00:31:39,264
often starting with this basic shapes.

299
00:31:41,904 --> 00:31:47,424
And then, uh, here using this rhythm, trying to find this rhythm with the
shapes.

300
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:56,784
So here, sometimes I draw some abstract shapes and then I try to come up with
things to, uh,

301
00:31:57,344 --> 00:32:02,784
to draw, for example, here, this fence, here, these bushes here, this tree.

302
00:32:04,304 --> 00:32:09,904
So starting with these abstract shapes, and then I'm starting to draw all these
construction,

303
00:32:10,944 --> 00:32:18,704
with all these, um, 3d shapes actually. Um, so here it's abstract and here I'm
trying to add

304
00:32:19,344 --> 00:32:22,783
more depth and that it makes more sense. Then I clean it up.

305
00:32:22,786 --> 00:32:29,424
And a lot of times I'm just using two or three types of shadows.

306
00:32:29,536 --> 00:32:34,335
Not more of that, because you're storyboarding and you're not making final
drawings,

307
00:32:34,338 --> 00:32:39,056
then it would take way too long time to actually draw.

308
00:32:40,656 --> 00:32:45,775
Composition characters, I think I've also covered this already,

309
00:32:45,778 --> 00:32:48,256
with having two characters against each other.

310
00:32:49,056 --> 00:32:52,096
Because this character is a bit lower than this character, so

311
00:32:52,816 --> 00:32:55,535
this self-esteem seems lower.

312
00:32:55,538 --> 00:33:06,096
So this character feels more dominant and this character feels weaker.

313
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:16,095
Again, try to use as few shadows as you can.

314
00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:21,535
So sometimes when I really need to draw something fast for storyboarding,

315
00:33:21,538 --> 00:33:31,801
and you have two characters.

316
00:33:31,804 --> 00:33:35,201
And you want to add some backgrounds.

317
00:33:35,204 --> 00:33:37,601
Sometimes you can just add this

318
00:33:37,604 --> 00:33:39,441
if you want to be really fast

319
00:33:39,444 --> 00:33:42,902
to give the impression that there's a roof or a sky.

320
00:33:43,962 --> 00:33:46,961
But sometimes this is a way more than enough,

321
00:33:46,964 --> 00:33:48,282
just this perspective.

322
00:33:52,802 --> 00:33:54,201
Positive and negative space.

323
00:33:54,204 --> 00:33:58,121
So this really is important for the readability.

324
00:33:58,124 --> 00:34:01,521
So this is all has to do with silhouette.

325
00:34:01,524 --> 00:34:06,522
So for example, if we're drawing a running character

326
00:34:08,182 --> 00:34:11,561
and we're drawing the character like this,

327
00:34:11,564 --> 00:34:16,562
you can see what's really happening.

328
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:21,041
But if we draw the character with the clear silhouettes,

329
00:34:21,044 --> 00:34:25,101
he's putting his arms more out and like this,

330
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:28,521
it's easier to read.

331
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:31,522
So this maybe...

332
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:38,063
seems obvious but yeah a lot of times this is not happening correctly and it's
also in

333
00:34:38,066 --> 00:34:50,064
the background so try to find an interesting balance with black and white and
you also

334
00:34:51,184 --> 00:34:57,663
here I find yeah this is super interesting right this yin yang sign

335
00:34:57,666 --> 00:35:09,823
so here that you have a balance or out of balance but yeah you can create a lot
of clarity with

336
00:35:09,826 --> 00:35:20,703
using these two so think about the silhouettes and that things are readable so
which you can

337
00:35:20,706 --> 00:35:28,144
even sometimes use so I'm showing that here the power of three can can use a lot
but

338
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,279
if you want to make more complex drawing you don't have to use more than three

339
00:35:33,282 --> 00:35:39,840
colors for example if we have

340
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:49,369
Let me show here again, can use this one again.

341
00:35:49,372 --> 00:36:00,049
So now there's, it's either black or white, but if we're using a gray tone, for
example

342
00:36:00,052 --> 00:36:03,769
here, that adds a lot.

343
00:36:03,772 --> 00:36:07,349
So then you also get this point of interest here.

344
00:36:07,352 --> 00:36:16,909
So I try to use for storyboarding, uh, to, uh, values that sometimes you can
use, uh,

345
00:36:16,912 --> 00:36:27,349
use three to, to give more, um, yeah, for example, especially for something like
this.

346
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:30,750
And again, with storyboarding, you're using more line work.

347
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:38,430
Um, but it is interesting and try to avoid using too much values in your, in
your drawings.

348
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:44,350
Uh, contrast, um.

349
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:53,119
Of course, for storyboarding, you're avoiding colors, but sometimes you do use
some, some

350
00:36:53,122 --> 00:36:54,960
colors, but let's start with value.

351
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:04,399
So when we're making a background or a thing, and then you have, and you want to
have this

352
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:05,439
character stand out.

353
00:37:05,442 --> 00:37:11,039
And if you make the rest really black and white and this character black, then
it stands

354
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:12,560
out, but you can also use it.

355
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:20,559
And then here, why it's so that's creates, yeah, really our attention is really
built.

356
00:37:20,562 --> 00:37:26,639
So the biggest contrast is by using a value.

357
00:37:26,642 --> 00:37:31,040
So if you really want to let something stand out, value is really great.

358
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:37,760
Proximity, uh, means that you, uh, have all these shapes close to each other.

359
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,719
And then we have this character standing alone.

360
00:37:40,722 --> 00:37:44,640
So that makes this character really getting the attention.

361
00:37:44,928 --> 00:37:51,248
So Yui, so for example, if everything is green and use one red thing, that thing
stands out as well.

362
00:37:51,968 --> 00:37:56,688
So we're going from, this is the strongest contrast, then proximity, then Yui.

363
00:37:57,728 --> 00:38:04,127
Edge, yeah, and these blurred out things don't get the attention, but this sharp
thing

364
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:16,127
gets our attention. Direction, so yeah, where our eyes are trained or evolved to
pick out those

365
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:23,248
things that stand out also with that direction. Or the saturation, for example,
this all green,

366
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:29,967
when we're looking at color, for example, this is our saturation, so this is
100%,

367
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:42,768
this is 50% and this is zero, white. But if we have all

368
00:38:44,336 --> 00:38:50,095
thing with this and then we put in one thing this here. I hope you can see it
here. Maybe

369
00:38:50,098 --> 00:38:56,335
I can make this a little bit lighter so this value will stand out. But this is
something

370
00:38:56,338 --> 00:39:02,976
you would use more with painting. You rarely use it with storyboarding.

371
00:39:04,816 --> 00:39:10,335
Maybe UI sometimes, maybe you want to use really occasional for some kind of
effect.

372
00:39:10,338 --> 00:39:19,615
You want to use some UI shapes, everything is square and you put one round shape
and your

373
00:39:19,618 --> 00:39:24,896
eye will get caught by that round shape. Proportion, all small shapes, one big
shape.

374
00:39:26,016 --> 00:39:32,015
Texture, that everything is really smooth. But one thing that has a lot of
detail or texture

375
00:39:32,018 --> 00:39:39,616
gets the attention. So don't put details everywhere. Try to put details on one
point.

376
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:46,009
reading direction, and that's really important

377
00:39:46,012 --> 00:39:51,010
for storyboarding, and this is in some cultures

378
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:54,450
really different, so in the West,

379
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:02,090
we're reading from the top left to the right

380
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:07,970
and then towards the bottom, so we're also using that

381
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:11,450
when we're seeing, for example, if we're seeing a car

382
00:40:11,490 --> 00:40:13,649
going from left to right, we have the feeling

383
00:40:13,652 --> 00:40:17,949
that car is going somewhere, but if it's going

384
00:40:17,952 --> 00:40:21,009
from right to left, we have the feeling

385
00:40:21,012 --> 00:40:26,010
he's going back home, the same with character,

386
00:40:26,270 --> 00:40:28,629
so this character is going to work,

387
00:40:28,632 --> 00:40:31,429
but then we're seeing he's going back,

388
00:40:31,432 --> 00:40:34,109
maybe he forgot his keys or something,

389
00:40:34,112 --> 00:40:38,240
so try to think about why you're seeing

390
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,240
you're using left to right or which way your character or car is moving to.

391
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:53,519
Here again the bird is flying away maybe looking for food and he's coming back

392
00:40:53,522 --> 00:41:04,479
with food from the right to left bottom. So actually here this is this movement
and then here this

393
00:41:04,482 --> 00:41:18,720
movement. Same yeah this is with the corner so if we're having this car you want
to have this

394
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:27,679
space in front of the car maybe you're using the screen to move along with the
car so it's

395
00:41:27,682 --> 00:41:34,239
always staying here or the car moves out of the screen but what you don't want
is when you're

396
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:37,200
starting the scene starts to arise with this because then you...

397
00:41:37,504 --> 00:41:42,583
Yeah, it feels just weird, especially here with this character.

398
00:41:42,586 --> 00:41:48,783
So when you don't want to, maybe it's a bit confusing because there you see this
here.

399
00:41:48,786 --> 00:41:56,143
So when we're having a character that is looking at the sea, you don't want to
draw it like

400
00:41:56,146 --> 00:41:57,823
this.

401
00:41:57,826 --> 00:42:07,623
You want to move the character here and let him having this eye of this space to
look

402
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:12,583
at.

403
00:42:12,586 --> 00:42:19,063
For example, here this spaceship, don't put the spaceship too much to this
space.

404
00:42:19,066 --> 00:42:29,823
Let it have the space here and not here behind it, but in front of.

405
00:42:29,826 --> 00:42:36,544
Tangents, so that's something you want to avoid when you're drawing.

406
00:42:37,184 --> 00:42:47,143
Basically, it's when two objects or lines touch each other at the same borders.

407
00:42:47,146 --> 00:42:53,743
You can also see like this, if you're having these lines going like this here,
it gets

408
00:42:53,746 --> 00:43:00,663
so much attention and unless it's on purpose, but most of the time you don't
want that.

409
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:12,903
So how you better can draw these lines is that maybe like this, or these shapes
use overlap

410
00:43:12,906 --> 00:43:15,583
like this.

411
00:43:15,586 --> 00:43:19,343
That creates also more depth.

412
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:23,863
You can see it with this, for example, if you have this car with this tree, it
feels

413
00:43:23,866 --> 00:43:30,143
like this car is against the tree, so you can choose to move it a bit so there's
more

414
00:43:30,146 --> 00:43:33,664
space between it, or use this overlap.

415
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,920
to really show that the car is behind the tree.

416
00:43:43,130 --> 00:43:58,449
so shadow and light again I'm trying to use as few values as I can so when I for

417
00:43:58,452 --> 00:44:04,729
example we have a ball and we want to shade it first I decide where's the

418
00:44:04,732 --> 00:44:14,649
light coming from from this corner and then fill this so a good exercise to do

419
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:21,849
this is to take a light and maybe a ball or an object and see what how you can

420
00:44:21,852 --> 00:44:28,869
shade the ball with one one tone and maybe you can use these for when you're

421
00:44:28,872 --> 00:44:41,023
drawing in the head use these kinds of shadows for for that and again

422
00:44:41,026 --> 00:44:45,424
This shows that you can do a lot with only showing one

423
00:44:48,584 --> 00:44:52,564
With only showing one shade of value you can do a lot
