00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:09,200
Perspective is really important for storyboarding. So let me show that. So here
I've made three

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:20,639
versions of shots with different perspectives. So here, let me draw this box.

3
00:00:20,642 --> 00:00:32,919
So this is the frame. So how to draw perspective? I made a whole ebook about
this and it's a pretty

4
00:00:32,922 --> 00:00:45,759
big subject. But let me go really quickly over it. Sorry. So here we have this
box and let's

5
00:00:45,762 --> 00:00:56,079
draw this horizon line. So you first pick the horizon line you want to use. So
this is a low,

6
00:00:56,082 --> 00:00:59,520
this is on one thirds. So

7
00:01:00,123 --> 00:01:02,555

We compress knowledge for you!

8
00:01:02,556 --> 00:01:07,743
then you choose a vanishing point and this vanishing point can be anywhere on
this line

9
00:01:07,746 --> 00:01:12,224
and then you're drawing these lines from also from the other side.

10
00:01:14,464 --> 00:01:20,464
You can also choose to go for one point perspective and then we have the basic
perspective

11
00:01:21,424 --> 00:01:26,784
and you can use this for example to draw a wall.

12
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:33,024
So here we're following this line and then we're going straight up

13
00:01:33,904 --> 00:01:41,663
and then or let's make this line here and then we can also follow this line here
for this.

14
00:01:41,666 --> 00:01:48,464
So that is how I use perspective. We can also add a ceiling like this

15
00:01:50,464 --> 00:01:59,264
so here so now we have this this wall

16
00:01:59,776 --> 00:02:08,735
and then you can draw this now you can draw characters here so and actually

17
00:02:08,738 --> 00:02:19,575
because this is lower let me draw this so here so what we're actually seeing

18
00:02:19,578 --> 00:02:28,775
here would look something like this so two people in a room and the ceiling is

19
00:02:28,778 --> 00:02:38,215
somewhere something like here and the camera is at this height so here it's

20
00:02:38,218 --> 00:02:43,815
the eye level and again that's a whole different subject and I'm telling more

21
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:54,255
about that in perspective ebook but I wanted to share how I draw a basic

22
00:02:54,258 --> 00:02:59,087
perspective like this so let me also show

23
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:12,327
those other ones like you can also choose to draw the horizon line a bit higher
like

24
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,327
here.

25
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:20,327
So you just draw a horizon line and then there's a person or let me draw these
perspective

26
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,327
lines again.

27
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:29,067
You can also guess them so when you're storyboarding you want to draw quickly so
maybe you don't

28
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:34,907
draw the whole finishing point etc but you make these rough lines and that's
totally

29
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:37,027
fine.

30
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:50,777
So here, draw this character here and this other character here.

31
00:03:50,780 --> 00:04:00,697
like this and how this would look like so we could draw again this here this

32
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:10,097
wall here is ceiling something like this so how would this look with the camera

33
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:20,817
so then the camera will be here and now the camera is at the eye level so here

34
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,697
drawn a character here and a character here so this character is this character

35
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:32,537
this character is this character and then there's the wall this like this

36
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:46,657
high so that is two-thirds horizon line and you can also use it to draw these

37
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,064
more organic perspectives

38
00:04:50,944 --> 00:04:58,544
So when you're drawing something from a bird's view, so when the camera is
really high,

39
00:04:59,904 --> 00:05:06,063
the horizon line is somewhere here. So imagine that this point is here and then
drawing all

40
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:13,183
these lines like this here. And for storyboarding, most of the time I'm drawing
them freehand

41
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:21,583
because of the time. And then you can draw in the, for example, here, this is a
city.

42
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:33,503
So there's a building here, here, here. So there's also a three-point
perspective,

43
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:41,424
but for storyboarding, I'm almost never using it. Or it's really important for
the

44
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:49,024
effect, but most of the time I'm avoiding that.

45
00:05:49,242 --> 00:05:58,961
so here so how would this look from the side we have the camera that is aiming

46
00:05:58,964 --> 00:06:08,701
down then here we have this character on this building and it's looking at all

47
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:16,641
these other buildings so you have this kind of shot so let's take a look at

48
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:33,081
crouch let's go down a bit and let's see this so we're calling this a one shot a

49
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:42,761
two shots the three shots four shots and it's and you can continue making five

50
00:06:42,764 --> 00:06:48,367
shots and six shots etc so the two refers to two characters

51
00:06:48,370 --> 00:07:05,807
and but you can also go to a group shot so group shot or a crowd shot and yeah

52
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:12,608
it's it's used for to really clarify that there are four characters in it yeah
if

53
00:07:12,688 --> 00:07:19,967
if you want you can even put numbers besides them to make more clearer so maybe
you have

54
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:24,528
multiple shots from different views and then having those numbers that it can
help

55
00:07:25,808 --> 00:07:29,888
show which character what is but you don't see this often but you could use it

56
00:07:31,408 --> 00:07:41,087
so what i'm trying to show here with these red lines is to group the the people
so especially

57
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,248
here with those big groups for example if we're

58
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:52,098
drawing a shot and there's a building here.

59
00:07:54,858 --> 00:07:59,858
And there are people waiting.

60
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:05,337
So it's really good to first maybe draw a big shape

61
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,258
and then draw all these people in this shape.

62
00:08:19,162 --> 00:08:34,441
so like this then you have this flow in it instead of just drawing all these

63
00:08:34,444 --> 00:08:41,962
people here we have this building all these people separate

64
00:08:47,034 --> 00:08:51,033
So that's going to look messy.

65
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:58,733
So try to group the people.

66
00:08:58,736 --> 00:09:06,873
So effects for storyboarding, and you want to keep it simple, but for example,
you could

67
00:09:06,876 --> 00:09:14,633
use if you want to make something cold, you can use this blue or for example,
these trees

68
00:09:14,636 --> 00:09:18,373
in the distance that is called atmospheric perspective.

69
00:09:18,376 --> 00:09:23,073
So when something is in the distance, things tend to fade out.

70
00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:29,353
Try to look out of the window and try to see, compare the farthest away thing
you can see

71
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:31,833
compared to a closer thing.

72
00:09:31,836 --> 00:09:39,153
Like if you see a tree close to where you're looking from, you can see all the
colors and

73
00:09:39,156 --> 00:09:41,193
all the values.

74
00:09:41,196 --> 00:09:45,554
If you look at the tree that is really, really far away.

75
00:09:46,144 --> 00:09:55,743
It will look with less contrast in a value.

76
00:09:55,746 --> 00:10:03,105
So that's what I tried to mimic with these colors, with these fade out values.

77
00:10:03,105 --> 00:10:04,434

We compress knowledge for you!

78
00:10:05,864 --> 00:10:12,663
So you can also use the snow particles like I did here.

79
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:16,823
So here it's snowing quite softly.

80
00:10:16,826 --> 00:10:20,703
Here I used this blur effect of this soft brush.

81
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:24,183
And then you have that mist effect.

82
00:10:24,186 --> 00:10:29,823
One simple way to do that in Photoshop is to use the gradient tool.

83
00:10:29,826 --> 00:10:33,983
So that is under this paint bucket tool, we have this gradient tool.

84
00:10:33,986 --> 00:10:38,503
And then you can drag it and put it here.

85
00:10:38,506 --> 00:10:41,823
And then you can have that mist effect.

86
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:45,664
And keep it all simple and really functional.

87
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:47,352
All those things.

88
00:10:48,952 --> 00:10:50,272
So heavy storm.

89
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:57,632
Um, so we're choosing a direction and we're making those snow, uh, flakes

90
00:10:57,912 --> 00:11:03,592
longer, so like this, and then because of it's this direction, it feels

91
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:06,112
like there's this energy behind.

92
00:11:06,392 --> 00:11:11,111
And then we have this character that is going in the opposite direction.

93
00:11:11,114 --> 00:11:14,391
So when you're walking through a storm, you're leaning forward.

94
00:11:14,394 --> 00:11:16,072
So you won't get blown away.

95
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:22,832
Um, here, soft brush effect to create this mist effect.

96
00:11:26,272 --> 00:11:35,592
So here, and we're taking this soft brush.

97
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:39,311
So what I'm doing in Photoshop, you have shape dynamics, but you also have

98
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:43,712
transfer a bit, uh, uh, the hardness on zero.

99
00:11:44,392 --> 00:11:45,529
Okay.

100
00:11:45,532 --> 00:11:58,010
so and you can draw in those soft mist effects

101
00:12:01,818 --> 00:12:05,738
So let me see here.

102
00:12:09,778 --> 00:12:13,017
Yeah, and this is then extreme and combined.

103
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,577
So you can see that I used,

104
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,697
let me take the,

105
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,577
oh, let me select the right brush.

106
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,978
So I want to have this hard brush with the shape dynamics.

107
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:30,977
Here you can see I used these lines for the character

108
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:33,098
also to add some effects

109
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:39,098
and also using these wind strokes.

110
00:12:42,978 --> 00:12:46,618
So those are a couple of effects you could use.

111
00:12:48,098 --> 00:12:49,418
Here are some more,

112
00:12:51,778 --> 00:12:55,577
often using foreground and background elements.

113
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,857
Also here again,

114
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:59,297
here in this foreground it's quite dark

115
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,392
and in the background it's lighter.

116
00:13:01,472 --> 00:13:05,952
So that's again that atmospheric perspective and that will help you

117
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:11,231
create depth in your drawings.

118
00:13:11,234 --> 00:13:12,432
You can also use blur.

119
00:13:15,232 --> 00:13:21,551
So now the focus is on this character using foreshortening.

120
00:13:21,554 --> 00:13:26,912
So that's this perspective trick that when you're drawing an arm or cylinder

121
00:13:27,872 --> 00:13:32,031
this side looks bigger than this side when this is farther away.

122
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:33,792
So if we're looking at the camera.

123
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:39,312
So this is what the side looks like.

124
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:43,151
But here this is closer to the camera.

125
00:13:43,154 --> 00:13:48,191
So that is this part and this is farther away and it looks that part.

126
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,312
Again that's perspective.

127
00:13:51,632 --> 00:13:55,711
How I draw, let me draw this shot to show that a bit.

128
00:13:55,714 --> 00:14:00,512
So here we're drawing these shots.

129
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:04,623
And we want to have this bunny here.

130
00:14:04,626 --> 00:14:06,784
And let's draw this perspective.

131
00:14:08,544 --> 00:14:12,304
Freehand, something like this.

132
00:14:13,344 --> 00:14:17,904
And then we have this bunny, the head, the body, the legs.

133
00:14:19,264 --> 00:14:21,904
So then you can draw on top of this circle.

134
00:14:24,384 --> 00:14:28,544
So here using this cylinder to draw the arm.

135
00:14:29,504 --> 00:14:31,663
And then here and et cetera.

136
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:42,384
So I'm using these balls to draw the character and this perspective.

137
00:14:42,618 --> 00:14:54,457
When to cut in your shots, this can be quite hard and complex, but try to keep
it as simple

138
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,777
as possible.

139
00:14:55,780 --> 00:15:02,137
So here we see an over the shoulder shot, character two is speaking to character
one,

140
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,497
then character one starts to talk.

141
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:14,617
So you actually see him starting to talk, then you cut while character one is
talking,

142
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,057
you cut to this shot.

143
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:20,377
So there's this continuation in it.

144
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:22,217
And then this character listening.

145
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,657
So the same now if this character is going to talk again, so we would have a
shot where

146
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,577
he opens his mouth.

147
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,097
So this is the best drawing ever.

148
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,698
So and then here we have this character starting to listen.

149
00:15:42,522 --> 00:15:47,221
And then we cut again to a next shot

150
00:15:47,224 --> 00:15:52,222
where we see this character from the front.

151
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:56,142
And then this one is listening.

152
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:04,582
The same when, so this person is reaching out

153
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:06,562
for his pencil.

154
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:10,841
At the moment that he moves his arm,

155
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:14,461
let the viewer show that he's moving his arm a bit.

156
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:18,801
Then you cut to the shot where you see the hand

157
00:16:18,804 --> 00:16:21,082
continuation with that movement.

158
00:16:23,082 --> 00:16:25,061
And then he grabs the hand.

159
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:30,001
So if you leave this out, it can be a bit too hard.

160
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:31,602
The cuts can be too hard.

161
00:16:33,402 --> 00:16:36,321
So you have that continuation of movement

162
00:16:36,324 --> 00:16:39,082
in your, before your cuts.

163
00:16:40,842 --> 00:16:42,016
Here's another one.

164
00:16:42,176 --> 00:16:50,096
So we see this character ready to go eat, but then here's a sound and you see
his head moving.

165
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:57,055
And here at this point, you see also a little bit movement. And then he looks at
the dog and

166
00:16:57,058 --> 00:17:02,335
he knows where the sound's coming from. But then there's this continuation in
the,

167
00:17:02,338 --> 00:17:08,495
in what's happening and moving. So some storyboard rules.

168
00:17:08,498 --> 00:17:15,536
So these kinds of storyboards you will see in, often when they're working,

169
00:17:16,896 --> 00:17:21,456
those are used for television shows often, these kinds of storyboards.

170
00:17:22,256 --> 00:17:27,216
And they have the panel, et cetera, background scene. And here this,

171
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:35,935
here also this part. And for oftentimes for movies, it's different. For movies,
they

172
00:17:35,938 --> 00:17:42,176
often just only use this part.

173
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:47,009
So let me explain a bit what everything is.

174
00:17:47,012 --> 00:17:52,010
So here we have the scene.

175
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:55,089
And so this is for example, scene one

176
00:17:55,092 --> 00:17:57,090
and the movie starts with scene one.

177
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,849
And you have the panel A.

178
00:18:01,852 --> 00:18:06,850
So scene three, panel A, scene three, panel B, et cetera.

179
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,769
And you're using these background numbers

180
00:18:11,772 --> 00:18:13,929
to tell, or you can use,

181
00:18:13,932 --> 00:18:16,369
here you can use the backgrounds

182
00:18:16,372 --> 00:18:20,810
from B also used in scene three, panel A.

183
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:25,529
Here you can put notes for telling about

184
00:18:25,532 --> 00:18:27,609
what kind of effects there are.

185
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:31,929
A dialogue, so what they are talking about.

186
00:18:31,932 --> 00:18:34,969
Transition, what kind of transition is between the cuts

187
00:18:34,972 --> 00:18:36,329
and between the shots.

188
00:18:36,332 --> 00:18:39,269
Slugging is for the timing.

189
00:18:39,272 --> 00:18:41,830
So how long.

190
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,560
The shot should be in, uh, in, uh, in the screen.

191
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:57,159
So here we have this girl walking in and here, uh, using this arrow, uh, you
can,

192
00:18:57,162 --> 00:19:02,760
you, you can draw this arrow on top of it, uh, here safe area.

193
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,799
Um, that is for, especially when you're working for TV, you're working with

194
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:12,160
different, uh, televisions at home.

195
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:18,200
So this area at some, uh, televisions, you will see this, but others you won't.

196
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,359
So this is the safe area here.

197
00:19:20,362 --> 00:19:22,720
You want to have all the, the action.

198
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:35,480
Um, so here, um, three a, so this is still the same scene, but the new cuts.

199
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,200
So then you're just placing an A behind it and then you.

200
00:19:39,264 --> 00:19:43,063
It starts counting again with the panel A.

201
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:48,064
So this scene 3A, panel A, and there's a new background.

202
00:19:49,564 --> 00:19:52,024
And you can see the dialogue here.

203
00:19:54,724 --> 00:19:57,903
You can use here for, if you're using a pen,

204
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:01,883
you draw those red arrows like this on top of it.

205
00:20:01,886 --> 00:20:03,263
So that means that there's pen

206
00:20:03,266 --> 00:20:08,263
and you can draw between those shots.

207
00:20:08,266 --> 00:20:10,543
So sometimes they even post post-its

208
00:20:10,546 --> 00:20:15,544
on these kind of sheets to do what they want.

209
00:20:15,704 --> 00:20:17,983
Here you can see this transition.

210
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:20,383
So here's this cross dissolve,

211
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:22,023
just putting a cross between it

212
00:20:22,026 --> 00:20:23,843
and we're calling it cross dissolve.

213
00:20:23,846 --> 00:20:27,464
That means that this shot fades into this shot.

214
00:20:28,464 --> 00:20:30,383
Here's this zoom in.

215
00:20:30,386 --> 00:20:33,903
So with those red lines, et cetera.

216
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:38,064
So again, this is how they are using.

217
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:45,824
Or at least a lot of studios are working with these kind of sheets in for
television animation.

218
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:55,023
So here are some explanation. So this is called a fade out. So that means when

219
00:20:55,026 --> 00:21:10,343
a shot, so we have this shot here, transfers into another shot. And you also
have this

220
00:21:10,346 --> 00:21:18,943
cross to solve. But the difference between, let me see how I can best tell this.
Let me

221
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:29,543
just draw this here. So here we have this character like this here, and then
it's fade

222
00:21:29,546 --> 00:21:37,944
out into into black. So like this, or you can have it starts with.

223
00:21:38,272 --> 00:21:43,272
And black shots, oh, and then it fades in this here.

224
00:21:50,672 --> 00:21:54,071
And you also have that cross to solve I showed earlier,

225
00:21:54,074 --> 00:21:59,071
and then it's looking like this.

226
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:04,072
Like this, or yeah, you're trying to avoid

227
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:09,471
to make those shots too different.

228
00:22:09,474 --> 00:22:11,192
So maybe something like this.

229
00:22:13,352 --> 00:22:15,851
So that's the cross dissolve.

230
00:22:15,854 --> 00:22:17,711
You also have a wipe dissolve.

231
00:22:17,714 --> 00:22:22,712
What that means is that, yeah, let me draw that here.

232
00:22:29,072 --> 00:22:35,072
And maybe there's an elephant like this.

233
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:43,736
Then we have this frame here.

234
00:22:48,056 --> 00:22:51,816
And that moves in like this.

235
00:22:53,616 --> 00:22:57,495
So you have this shot here

236
00:22:57,498 --> 00:23:02,176
and then this other shot moves in.

237
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:08,416
But you will see, and I never really use this a lot.

238
00:23:08,976 --> 00:23:13,976
But it's used in, you don't see it a lot in movies,

239
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:19,535
but then it's actually, you would have this line

240
00:23:19,538 --> 00:23:24,095
or this completely different shot between there.

241
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:28,975
So that's when basically a different shot is moving in.

242
00:23:28,978 --> 00:23:31,256
Star Wars is often using that.

243
00:23:33,016 --> 00:23:38,016
A ripple dissolve, so that's kind of when the other shots

244
00:23:38,896 --> 00:23:45,296
turns into the next shot, then you have that ripple effect. So think of it as if
you see that

245
00:23:46,576 --> 00:23:56,496
water effect, so that for example, again I need to have this on a brush,

246
00:24:01,216 --> 00:24:05,776
pen pressure, let me take this sketch brush,

247
00:24:08,976 --> 00:24:11,856
here in the first shot you see this, this character,

248
00:24:13,856 --> 00:24:17,936
and then it fades, it ripples out like this,

249
00:24:21,296 --> 00:24:28,496
then the next shot looks really like this, can't almost see anything about it,
and then

250
00:24:30,496 --> 00:24:34,735
it starts moving into these two characters

251
00:24:34,738 --> 00:24:38,816
until you have that.

252
00:24:40,432 --> 00:24:46,592
until you see those two characters like this. So it's a transition between those
two shots

253
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:57,071
like that. So the iris out or in is basically, yeah, think of the Looney Tunes
stuff when you

254
00:24:57,074 --> 00:25:04,751
have that circle that is moving in and then it's until it's completely black.

255
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:16,512
And that's when you often you see that at the end of a movie or TV show.

256
00:25:17,658 --> 00:25:21,138
So some more cuts and effects.

257
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:25,177
So sometimes you can use this,

258
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:29,017
so then you have maybe a shot

259
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:32,298
and then it moves to the shots of someone's house.

260
00:25:36,258 --> 00:25:38,377
And then you can use this swoosh pen,

261
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,377
for example, when you're,

262
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,497
oh, I need to go to home to warm,

263
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:48,977
to warn my girlfriend.

264
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,617
And then you're moving the swoosh pen,

265
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,098
then you see the home.

266
00:25:54,098 --> 00:25:57,457
Edge swipe, again, that's what you see a lot with,

267
00:25:57,460 --> 00:26:00,297
for example, with Star Wars,

268
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,617
where you see this black box going to the screen.

269
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:07,697
And you can also use it with the shots or something.

270
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,817
So clock wipe,

271
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:14,098
and that means that it starts.

272
00:26:15,546 --> 00:26:17,985
you get this effect.

273
00:26:17,988 --> 00:26:22,986
So then this thing starting to get filled like this

274
00:26:25,706 --> 00:26:28,386
until it's really black.

275
00:26:32,346 --> 00:26:36,426
Then it's starting to fill on and on.

276
00:26:37,906 --> 00:26:41,945
But you can just use this symbol.

277
00:26:41,948 --> 00:26:46,946
So here is this cross to solve you're using

278
00:26:48,866 --> 00:26:53,506
between those shots are fade out or fading.

279
00:26:54,466 --> 00:26:59,466
So again, when you're working on a movie shots,

280
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:06,145
what I'm doing when I'm working on a storyboard

281
00:27:06,148 --> 00:27:11,145
for more for a movie, I'm just drawing the whole shots.

282
00:27:11,148 --> 00:27:15,855
And this, so then there's no.

283
00:27:15,858 --> 00:27:23,535
I'll make one drawing like this and then the next drawing I'm also making like
this.

284
00:27:23,538 --> 00:27:26,935
So there's no space to make these crosses on the sides.

285
00:27:26,938 --> 00:27:30,976
That's often used for more for television.

286
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:39,553
So the mouse storyboard.

287
00:27:39,556 --> 00:27:44,554
So this is one I made some time ago

288
00:27:45,994 --> 00:27:49,793
and what I want to show here,

289
00:27:49,796 --> 00:27:54,794
you have these kinds of different levels of drawing.

290
00:27:55,274 --> 00:27:59,073
So this is most really detailed

291
00:27:59,076 --> 00:28:04,074
and usually I don't work with such a detailed drawing

292
00:28:05,594 --> 00:28:10,594
because this takes a lot of time to actually draw.

293
00:28:11,834 --> 00:28:13,554
However, you could use this,

294
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:17,353
especially for when you're working for commercials

295
00:28:17,356 --> 00:28:22,273
or something they want to have really detailed storyboards

296
00:28:22,276 --> 00:28:25,433
often because they are presenting it to people

297
00:28:25,436 --> 00:28:28,033
who don't have storyboard knowledge.

298
00:28:28,036 --> 00:28:30,794
So they really need, it's almost a comic.

299
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:38,927
So here I already made it a little bit more simple, a bit less details, but
still a lot.

300
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:44,607
So if we go to the next one, you can see I left out a lot of details.

301
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:49,168
Sometimes I just draw the floor like these perspective lines, even here.

302
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:55,488
So and just one shade of shadow.

303
00:28:56,288 --> 00:28:59,408
And I usually storyboard like this because it's fast

304
00:29:00,128 --> 00:29:03,328
and easy and still clear to see what is happening.

305
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,408
So here I made the summary of that.

306
00:29:13,008 --> 00:29:17,167
Yeah, most of the studios draw in this kind of storyboards.

307
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:23,407
And I would recommend you to go to Google and type in your favorite animation
movie

308
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:28,127
and type storyboards behind it and you will find the storyboards.

309
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:31,136
And most of the time they look like this.

310
00:29:31,856 --> 00:29:35,216
And sometimes you see storyboards that are drawn like this and those are

311
00:29:36,016 --> 00:29:41,616
most of the time made for commercials. And of course there's also something
between.

312
00:29:46,336 --> 00:29:48,096
So, birth camera.

313
00:29:51,616 --> 00:29:54,895
Here we see this.

314
00:29:54,898 --> 00:30:07,295
Yeah, well, how do I want to tell this? So here, yeah. So a lot of times I'm
starting

315
00:30:07,298 --> 00:30:14,575
with a floor plan. So, and that's basically drawing from the top, the whole
scene, just

316
00:30:14,578 --> 00:30:21,375
really basic. And it helps me to know where, how I want to plan everything. So,
and this

317
00:30:21,378 --> 00:30:28,096
was the story that there was this bird with his mouse on top of him. And this
bird is flying

318
00:30:30,096 --> 00:30:31,408
under.

319
00:30:32,048 --> 00:30:37,807
this bridge. And here you can see the different cameras. So this is one camera
that's moving in

320
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:47,247
this and that. So what's happening, this camera is also flying along, but then
it's also rotating,

321
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:52,208
so it's following this bird. And then when the bird is flying under the bridge,

322
00:30:52,848 --> 00:31:01,008
then we cut to the second camera. So and then I start drawing it basically in.

323
00:31:01,408 --> 00:31:06,207
Here's the zoom in of this character. And then we're going back with the camera,

324
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:11,008
and then the camera starting to rotate a little bit. And then the camera stands
still.

325
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:19,727
And then we see him flying under the bridge. And then we have the shot of the
birds from underneath

326
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:29,007
and I will show that in the next ones. So here you can actually see, so this is
a rough,

327
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:30,608
also rough planning. So

328
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:41,199
I won't show anyone else this, but this is the final storyboard. And so here
this camera

329
00:31:41,202 --> 00:31:50,559
is moving like this. So here we're seeing it from the sides and here from the
back.

330
00:31:50,562 --> 00:31:58,919
So here, let me see. Yeah, here also this plan, how it looks from the top. So
when

331
00:31:58,922 --> 00:32:05,080
something complicated, you can draw these drawings from the top to plan it all
out.

332
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:15,799
So again, this is then the zooming and the camera zooms out. And when it's
zoomed out,

333
00:32:15,802 --> 00:32:23,559
I choose to decide to rotate the camera to follow the bird and character. So
it's also

334
00:32:23,562 --> 00:32:30,440
revealing. So because this is our hero and this is the friend, so we're making
revealing this bird.

335
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,480
in this shot.

336
00:32:36,282 --> 00:32:41,282
So here we have this, again, the shot.

337
00:32:44,282 --> 00:32:49,121
So this is when he's going under the bridge or the jump.

338
00:32:49,124 --> 00:32:51,601
So here we're following these birds

339
00:32:51,604 --> 00:32:56,602
and the camera is following at the same space as the birds

340
00:32:59,042 --> 00:33:02,121
and here it stands still at this point.

341
00:33:02,124 --> 00:33:05,361
Then you can see that the bird is flying farther away

342
00:33:05,364 --> 00:33:08,761
and then we're making the cut here.

343
00:33:08,764 --> 00:33:12,161
You see him flying beneath the bridge.

344
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:16,001
What's happening here, here we have this camera

345
00:33:16,004 --> 00:33:18,761
and this camera stays at this position.

346
00:33:18,764 --> 00:33:22,761
The bird flies to us and then over the camera

347
00:33:22,764 --> 00:33:27,762
and the camera moves, yeah, it makes this rotation.

348
00:33:28,402 --> 00:33:33,401
Basically this from the side, it looks like this.

349
00:33:33,404 --> 00:33:35,999
So here's the bird here.

350
00:33:36,002 --> 00:33:50,919
When the bird is here, the camera goes this rotation, and then here, like this.

351
00:33:50,922 --> 00:33:54,679
So the camera makes this rotation.

352
00:33:54,682 --> 00:34:01,479
And again, drawing these kind of little drawings helped me plan it out a bit.

353
00:34:01,482 --> 00:34:11,199
So whenever a shot is really complicated, try to draw those things out first.

354
00:34:11,202 --> 00:34:18,199
And then I also want to talk a bit about how to develop your own storyboards.

355
00:34:18,202 --> 00:34:26,359
So as a storyboard artist, it's important to know how to write your own stories.

356
00:34:26,362 --> 00:34:33,560
I really see that as a thing that I find really difficult to do, but still it's
really good to do.

357
00:34:33,648 --> 00:34:39,007
You don't have to become a story writer, but making your own stories can really
help,

358
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:44,367
because it shows you know the rules and how to work with material.

359
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:47,248
So start with a simple idea for a story.

360
00:34:48,048 --> 00:34:51,328
It can be just a simple Alinea, just really basic.

361
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:54,527
Then draw in the main characters.

362
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:59,648
And with storyboarding, you're not a character designer,

363
00:35:00,608 --> 00:35:03,408
but it can help too.

364
00:35:04,048 --> 00:35:08,608
So sometimes you're so early in the process that there's no character artist

365
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:10,927
who made the characters yet.

366
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:14,607
So you can make the first proportions.

367
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:18,927
So these ones will help you with drawing the storyboard,

368
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:22,207
because then you already thought about the design.

369
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:27,807
And also think about, yeah, for example, the bully.

370
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:30,768
So I made this big guy to, yeah.

371
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:35,583
To fill in that stereotype that, that you can see that he's a bully without

372
00:35:35,586 --> 00:35:39,343
even reading the text, the friends, et cetera.

373
00:35:39,346 --> 00:35:43,744
So think if the description matches the official, how they look.

374
00:35:46,624 --> 00:35:55,184
So, um, With that, uh, with that small story, you can already start drawing,

375
00:35:55,984 --> 00:36:03,824
uh, maybe four drawings where you're showing the main, the most important shots
of the,

376
00:36:04,864 --> 00:36:07,663
of the, uh, of the story.

377
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,184
And we call those story beats.

378
00:36:10,064 --> 00:36:17,023
You can also draw more, but, um, the ways that you drawing the most important
drawings,

379
00:36:17,026 --> 00:36:19,103
and you can just draw a couple.

380
00:36:19,106 --> 00:36:22,463
So you can use this also for when you're making the pitch for your story.

381
00:36:22,466 --> 00:36:29,984
So then you, uh, take your summary of your, uh, and you make it.

382
00:36:30,112 --> 00:36:36,032
Uh, a script and here I choose to make just a simple, it's not even one sheet of
paper.

383
00:36:37,312 --> 00:36:40,832
And, uh, here you can see it's act one.

384
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:47,312
So the beginning of the story and act two, and this is then the part.

385
00:36:48,032 --> 00:36:52,192
Remember for the beginning of this course where I showed, uh, so this,

386
00:36:54,752 --> 00:36:56,192
I can draw the circle.

387
00:36:56,912 --> 00:37:00,032
So this is one, two, three, four.

388
00:37:01,392 --> 00:37:07,071
So at the beginning, and then there's the second act and then the third act.

389
00:37:07,074 --> 00:37:20,992
So act one, and, um, this is, these two are act two together and act three.

390
00:37:21,952 --> 00:37:22,452
Three.

391
00:37:25,392 --> 00:37:28,992
And when I have, uh, made this script.

392
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:36,368
I start scribbling really rough these, uh, images before I go, uh, continue with
storyboarding.

393
00:37:37,168 --> 00:37:44,287
And I do that because I like to put it on paper first before I start to really
draw everything

394
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:50,607
out. And some people don't even use these thumbnails. They go sit back and they
close

395
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:55,247
their eyes and they're going to imagine how everything looks. And then they
simply start

396
00:37:55,250 --> 00:38:01,728
storyboarding. But I like to plan, uh, ahead. So first drawing all these
different shots.

397
00:38:03,568 --> 00:38:08,927
So, um, this is part of the final storyboard I made for that story.

398
00:38:08,930 --> 00:38:14,368
So after I script and have those thumbnails, I just simply start with the first
shot.

399
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:19,887
And, uh, yeah, start drawing in out all these scenes. So maybe you start,

400
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,248
so these are a bit clean up. Maybe you start super, super rough

401
00:38:23,808 --> 00:38:27,328
and then you go, uh, clean it up once you like it.

402
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,599
Because, uh, also with this storyboard, I really changed, uh, changed a lot and
there's a lot

403
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:34,839
of work.

404
00:38:34,842 --> 00:38:41,479
So what I would recommend for your portfolio, if you want to become a storyboard
artist,

405
00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:48,979
it's really good to, to write your own story, um, keep it quite short, short.

406
00:38:48,982 --> 00:38:58,419
So the script, I would recommend keeping it in one, uh, A4 paper, one sheet of
paper,

407
00:38:58,422 --> 00:39:05,339
and then, um, use that to draw your storyboards and maybe make, uh, I think I've
made a storyboards

408
00:39:05,342 --> 00:39:08,299
of 180 panels.

409
00:39:08,302 --> 00:39:16,659
So don't go over 200, uh, panels because that's just too much and, um, yeah,
make whole story

410
00:39:16,662 --> 00:39:24,579
in those 200 pages or make one scene in 200 pages of a movie, um, and showing
that you

411
00:39:24,582 --> 00:39:27,220
can do something on that on your own.

412
00:39:27,568 --> 00:39:35,727
will convince studios that you will be able to, um, that they give you the
script and that you

413
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:42,528
can use it to, to make a strong scene of that. So that was the storyboarding
course.

414
00:39:43,568 --> 00:39:50,047
I hope you liked it and let me know if you have some questions about it. And
again, storyboarding

415
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:57,007
is great for if you want to become, um, there's a lot of opportunities for
storyboarding also

416
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:02,528
because it's a really hard job. There's, you need to be able to draw good and
fast.

417
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:09,247
And, uh, you need to know a lot about story. You need to have a lot of
concentration because it's

418
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:16,207
a lot of work. Um, but it's really cool because basically you're a director,
you, you, you're an

419
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:23,807
actor, you, you're a cameraman. Uh, you can draw a lot. You can work on the
biggest movies and, uh,

420
00:40:23,810 --> 00:40:26,928
and so on. So it's a really good choice.

421
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:36,512
So I hope you liked it and good luck with making your own storyboard. Thanks.
