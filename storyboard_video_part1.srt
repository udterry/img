00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,039
Hi everyone! So in this video I'm going to talk about storyboarding.

2
00:00:05,042 --> 00:00:13,440
And storyboarding is used to make animations, stories, commercials and it's even
used in games.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:23,199
And it's a way to visualize your idea in quick sketches so you can use that to
create the story

4
00:00:23,202 --> 00:00:29,600
and see where it works and where it doesn't. So let's start with the first
lesson.

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:37,440
So coming up with ideas. I think everyone can recognize this. You finally have
time to draw

6
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:47,600
and but you don't know what you can start drawing. So you start to go and think.

7
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:56,399
And a natural reaction is, at least for me, is that I go on surfing on the
internet,

8
00:00:56,402 --> 00:00:58,239
looking at social media.

9
00:00:58,242 --> 00:01:03,182
And I tell myself that it's for getting inspiration, but basically it's just
procrastination.

10
00:01:03,182 --> 00:01:04,567

We compress knowledge for you!

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,239
So just not starting on it.

12
00:01:09,242 --> 00:01:12,239
Sometimes I'm even going to play some games.

13
00:01:12,242 --> 00:01:22,239
But it does help. It can help you ease up your mind and make you a bit more
relaxed.

14
00:01:22,242 --> 00:01:27,240
But then you realize you just need to start.

15
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:36,239
A lot of times good ideas come from when you're under the shower or when you're
doing groceries.

16
00:01:36,242 --> 00:01:42,239
Or even when you're driving in the car or when you're in the train.

17
00:01:42,242 --> 00:01:52,239
What does help is to really think a lot about it when you're behind your PC or
when you're writing in your sketchbook.

18
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:57,711
But when you laid it next to you...

19
00:01:57,714 --> 00:02:01,792
and you go do something else, the back in your mind is still working on it.

20
00:02:03,472 --> 00:02:11,151
And sometimes when I can't come up with an idea, I start really basic. Like here
this girl with

21
00:02:11,154 --> 00:02:20,112
this house, or here this character with the pet, or maybe something from your
childhood.

22
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:30,671
Starting really simple can help you come up with ideas. But yeah, coming up with
ideas is hard work.

23
00:02:30,674 --> 00:02:44,831
And then sometimes it clicks when you're at a place where you won't expect it.

24
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:50,352
So...

25
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:57,999
What helps me is this method I learned from the Hero's Journey.

26
00:02:58,002 --> 00:03:09,999
Hero's Journey is a book I can really recommend and it's about the journey a
hero makes throughout a story.

27
00:03:10,002 --> 00:03:16,399
So, I think I can also use this image here.

28
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:20,399
Let's place this one here and this one here.

29
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:30,399
So, often times a story starts from home.

30
00:03:30,402 --> 00:03:36,399
So, here we see a character, a farmer working on his field.

31
00:03:36,402 --> 00:03:44,399
And then he gets an invite, maybe a letter, maybe there is someone knocking on
the door.

32
00:03:44,402 --> 00:03:48,399
And then there is the refusal.

33
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:51,343
So, here he gets the letter.

34
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:55,424
But he says, I don't, I want to stay at my home place.

35
00:03:56,024 --> 00:04:02,224
But a lot of times there is some mentor kind of character.

36
00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:08,143
Think of a wizard or maybe it's just someone else who he looks up to.

37
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:16,063
And, um, he convinces the hero to go on an adventure and this going on

38
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:20,744
adventure here in this circle, you can see here, you have this normal life.

39
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:22,784
And here's the adventure.

40
00:04:23,424 --> 00:04:26,664
So here's this border, the hero needs to cross.

41
00:04:27,304 --> 00:04:32,824
And sometimes you really literally see they're going through a portal or a door,

42
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:36,544
or they going to the plane to a different country.

43
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:46,663
So when they're in this new, uh, adventure in this special world, um, this, this

44
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:50,104
world is really different and they need to train.

45
00:04:50,752 --> 00:04:55,351
So they need to, the idea behind the hero journey

46
00:04:55,354 --> 00:05:00,352
is that the hero will make this kind of growth.

47
00:05:05,752 --> 00:05:08,851
He will learn some new things.

48
00:05:08,854 --> 00:05:13,852
So he will train and then he will go to the challenge,

49
00:05:16,312 --> 00:05:18,751
for example, to a castle.

50
00:05:18,754 --> 00:05:20,631
But then he will fail.

51
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:25,511
So this is most of the time halfway through the movie.

52
00:05:25,514 --> 00:05:28,692
And that's point the hero doesn't know.

53
00:05:30,592 --> 00:05:33,311
Yeah, maybe he will give up.

54
00:05:33,314 --> 00:05:35,112
Maybe he will almost give up.

55
00:05:36,592 --> 00:05:41,592
But then he, a lot of times there are friends

56
00:05:41,912 --> 00:05:46,912
who encourage him to go on and then he gets this reward.

57
00:05:48,752 --> 00:05:50,472
Then he will try.

58
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:58,776
Um, so then you will have a reward so he can go to challenge, make the challenge
again.

59
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:04,896
So for example, this in, in this case, it can be a Schwartz or something.

60
00:06:06,176 --> 00:06:11,255
Um, I think it's important to, to try to watch movies and try to recognize these

61
00:06:11,258 --> 00:06:17,736
things and also read that book from, um, the hero's journey about this.

62
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:22,495
So at this point, maybe the hero goes back to their normal

63
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:24,376
world and has the final battle.

64
00:06:25,656 --> 00:06:31,536
Because of this reward, the hero can, can beat the final battle.

65
00:06:31,576 --> 00:06:35,816
This can be a dragon, or it can be a personal fight or something.

66
00:06:36,216 --> 00:06:38,976
It can be also an inverse battle.

67
00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:46,215
But where, uh, the most important thing is that he gets back to the normal,

68
00:06:46,218 --> 00:06:49,136
his normal world, his normal life.

69
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:55,087
but he can beat the final battle and because of that he has this growth.

70
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:58,608
And now he gets back to the point where he started in the movie

71
00:06:59,648 --> 00:07:04,367
or in the story and he made some kind of growth in it.

72
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:11,328
So he's back at home and it's the same person plus growth.

73
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:18,048
So think of a lot of stories, a lot of movies are starting somewhere

74
00:07:18,848 --> 00:07:25,408
and the first scene a lot of times looks a lot like the last scene.

75
00:07:26,368 --> 00:07:32,207
And that's also because the hero made this kind of progression in the story.

76
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:40,047
And this way of making stories that's being used in ancient Greek.

77
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:49,008
And it's a really great way of telling a story with a message.

78
00:07:50,896 --> 00:07:57,215
And also these stories are often built up out of three acts.

79
00:07:57,218 --> 00:08:01,135
So we have the act one, that's the start of the story.

80
00:08:01,138 --> 00:08:02,256
So that's basically...

81
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,295
So turn this off.

82
00:08:05,298 --> 00:08:07,296
So this is basically act one.

83
00:08:08,816 --> 00:08:10,416
And this is act two.

84
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:17,296
It's the middle, but most of the time it's the biggest part of the story.

85
00:08:18,256 --> 00:08:20,255
And then we have act three.

86
00:08:20,258 --> 00:08:23,776
And that's the last part of that circle.

87
00:08:24,976 --> 00:08:26,815
So there are also these points.

88
00:08:26,818 --> 00:08:33,055
So here, this point is a lot of times the inciting incident.

89
00:08:33,058 --> 00:08:37,695
So that means that the hero, there's happening something to the hero

90
00:08:37,698 --> 00:08:40,816
that makes him choose to go into the adventure.

91
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:43,695
And there's also the climax.

92
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:49,056
And that's often the time when the hero goes back to the...

93
00:08:49,312 --> 00:08:55,192
to the normal, to normal life, but going to battle that last battle.

94
00:08:55,632 --> 00:08:56,571
So that's the climax.

95
00:08:56,574 --> 00:09:01,831
And you can also see that here in this graph, it goes up and then it goes down

96
00:09:01,834 --> 00:09:06,791
again to the resolution and the resolution means when he's home, but then you
will

97
00:09:06,794 --> 00:09:09,952
see that he's learned something.

98
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:17,471
And again, I'm not really a writer, but still, it's really good to know some

99
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:22,512
basics about this, but because this will help you understand story more.

100
00:09:23,392 --> 00:09:26,392
And, uh, again, I'm not a writer.

101
00:09:27,072 --> 00:09:32,691
I'm sometimes I make storyboards and then a lot of times I, this helps

102
00:09:32,694 --> 00:09:34,632
me understand those stories more.

103
00:09:35,312 --> 00:09:39,771
So I would really recommend, um, reading some textbooks about

104
00:09:39,774 --> 00:09:41,831
writing stories from writers.

105
00:09:41,834 --> 00:09:46,336
And that makes also.

106
00:09:46,656 --> 00:09:51,456
For example, when you're a storyboard artist can also really help you to talk to

107
00:09:54,496 --> 00:09:59,695
writers and ask them questions. So in a story, a lot of times you have all these
different

108
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:04,140
characters. Of course you have the hero, but you also have the mentor, some kind
of the dead figure

109
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:04,434
Subtitled by

We compress knowledge for you!

110
00:10:07,936 --> 00:10:14,895
or the person the hero is looking up to. So we have the sidekick. And a sidekick
can add some

111
00:10:14,898 --> 00:10:23,136
comic relief, can help humanize the hero because sometimes the hero is really
this perfect guy,

112
00:10:23,936 --> 00:10:34,416
but the sidekick can help tone it down. The herald, yeah, it doesn't have to be
a bad person,

113
00:10:35,296 --> 00:10:44,095
but it can be someone who makes the hero going into the special worlds. For
example,

114
00:10:44,098 --> 00:10:46,255
it can be the inciting incident.

115
00:10:46,258 --> 00:10:53,135
The herald steals something from the hero and the hero makes the decisions to go
chase after him

116
00:10:53,138 --> 00:11:00,575
and learn more about what's behind it. And there's also the trickster. Think
about all

117
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:08,895
the funny characters in movies and stories. We have the shapeshifter. You quite
see this

118
00:11:08,898 --> 00:11:20,255
character a lot. It's a person that maybe he seems A or B, but in the end it
appears to be the opposite.

119
00:11:20,258 --> 00:11:26,496
We have the guardian. So sometimes for a character to go to the special world or
go somewhere,

120
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:33,855
there's a guardian in front of it that gives a challenge to the hero. And the
guardian doesn't

121
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:42,816
need to be bad, but it's some kind of test for the hero. And of course we have
the villain, the evil, the shadow.

122
00:11:42,896 --> 00:11:46,015
So this is maybe, and it doesn't have to be someone else.

123
00:11:46,018 --> 00:11:47,935
It's going to also be in the hero.

124
00:11:47,938 --> 00:11:50,016
So we all have our shadows.

125
00:11:51,536 --> 00:11:54,576
So you can really use this figure early.

126
00:11:56,096 --> 00:11:59,535
Again, I learned this from the hero journey.

127
00:11:59,538 --> 00:12:03,455
And if you want to learn more about it, check that out.

128
00:12:03,458 --> 00:12:09,375
I just wanted to give some basics ideas of where I learned this from

129
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:15,215
and what kind of techniques I'm using to create my own stories

130
00:12:15,218 --> 00:12:18,016
or helping understand stories more.

131
00:12:19,216 --> 00:12:22,976
So a big part of storyboarding is composition.

132
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:33,536
And composition helps you read what's going on in the image.

133
00:12:34,096 --> 00:12:39,456
For example, here, this is really hard to, where do we need to look at first?

134
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:42,223
I don't know.

135
00:12:42,226 --> 00:12:46,704
Maybe this, but maybe for you it's this, or maybe for someone else is this,

136
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:49,104
but here it's more clear.

137
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:55,103
So we, here you can see, oh, it's about two characters are meeting each other.

138
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:56,304
This character is bigger.

139
00:12:56,864 --> 00:13:02,783
So maybe we are this character and we are seeing this other character.

140
00:13:02,786 --> 00:13:06,783
And then, yeah, you, you get this composition.

141
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,983
And also this road helps also this composition.

142
00:13:09,986 --> 00:13:17,424
And also this framing, these objects help framing these two characters.

143
00:13:19,104 --> 00:13:25,584
And in this tutorial, I will talk more about composition and how to use it.

144
00:13:26,384 --> 00:13:27,824
So aspect ratio.

145
00:13:28,864 --> 00:13:33,344
So when we're going to make a storyboard, we're working on a canvas.

146
00:13:33,984 --> 00:13:39,583
And for example, if we're going to make a cinema movie in a cinema,

147
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,424
they often use this screen.

148
00:13:41,616 --> 00:13:53,615
And currently we're using this widescreen, or no, currently I think we're using
this HD TV screen 16.9.

149
00:13:53,618 --> 00:14:01,615
So that is the, so in these numbers are saying what kind of ratio it is.

150
00:14:01,618 --> 00:14:06,615
So this is 16.

151
00:14:06,618 --> 00:14:10,615
Oh, this is 16 and this is nine high.

152
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:13,615
Um, yeah.

153
00:14:13,618 --> 00:14:16,615
Think about what kind of aspect ratio are using.

154
00:14:16,618 --> 00:14:23,615
Maybe it's for a book or maybe it's for television.

155
00:14:23,618 --> 00:14:37,615
So when I'm going to plan a scene, um, sometimes before I'm going to draw the
whole, the whole scene and so on,

156
00:14:37,618 --> 00:14:40,616
I'm starting to draw this plane, this ground plane.

157
00:14:41,184 --> 00:14:44,103
And you don't have to draw it in this perspective.

158
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:48,743
You can also draw it like this map.

159
00:14:48,746 --> 00:14:50,763
And later I will show more.

160
00:14:50,766 --> 00:14:51,943
But then you can think,

161
00:14:51,946 --> 00:14:53,703
I want to have this character

162
00:14:53,706 --> 00:14:56,323
that's saying hi to this character.

163
00:14:56,326 --> 00:14:59,663
And I think I want to have the camera here.

164
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,863
And maybe there's a tree here

165
00:15:01,866 --> 00:15:03,463
and maybe that's a tree here.

166
00:15:03,466 --> 00:15:04,983
So when you do this,

167
00:15:04,986 --> 00:15:07,724
this can help when you're later,

168
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:10,463
there's something helping

169
00:15:10,466 --> 00:15:15,464
because there's here this dino,

170
00:15:16,584 --> 00:15:17,824
beautiful dino.

171
00:15:19,144 --> 00:15:20,343
So like this,

172
00:15:20,346 --> 00:15:24,503
is attacking these two characters.

173
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:28,583
And we want to move the camera to here.

174
00:15:28,586 --> 00:15:31,583
And then we still know here's a tree

175
00:15:31,586 --> 00:15:35,063
and here's a tree and this tree is falling on.

176
00:15:35,066 --> 00:15:37,943
And then you can use that to create a shot.

177
00:15:37,946 --> 00:15:39,104
So for example,

178
00:15:41,466 --> 00:15:44,746
Here we're just seeing two characters

179
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:51,466
and here we're seeing this dino and these two characters.

180
00:16:00,106 --> 00:16:02,726
Like this, best drawing ever.

181
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:08,025
But a lot of times I'm making doodles like this

182
00:16:08,028 --> 00:16:10,425
to figure out what I want to draw

183
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,545
and if it will work and et cetera.

184
00:16:12,548 --> 00:16:14,785
Not every drawing needs to be perfect,

185
00:16:14,788 --> 00:16:19,465
especially not with storyboarding.

186
00:16:19,468 --> 00:16:24,466
So also try to learn all these different shots.

187
00:16:26,626 --> 00:16:31,626
So here this camera, when we see the full body,

188
00:16:31,986 --> 00:16:34,065
it's called a full shot.

189
00:16:34,068 --> 00:16:36,905
So that means the camera is a little bit further

190
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:39,346
from the object we're viewing it.

191
00:16:39,952 --> 00:16:46,351
So a medium shot is when we can see the character from a little bit above the
knees.

192
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:51,392
Here we're calling this a medium shot. Then the camera moves in a bit closer.

193
00:16:52,112 --> 00:16:58,591
So a close shot is like this here and then we're seeing this part of the
character.

194
00:16:58,594 --> 00:17:02,672
An extreme close shot is when the camera is really in his face.

195
00:17:03,632 --> 00:17:18,111
So these kinds of shots are often used and I think this close shot and a medium
shot is most used.

196
00:17:18,114 --> 00:17:22,272
So a full shot can really help to tell you what's going on.

197
00:17:22,832 --> 00:17:28,832
An extreme close shot can help you to show the emotion really clear.

198
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:32,111
But we're not using it that much.

199
00:17:32,114 --> 00:17:38,432
A really great way to practice this is to go watch an

200
00:17:39,088 --> 00:17:47,328
a movie and try to try to see if you can recognize all those different shots.

201
00:17:49,408 --> 00:17:55,968
So but there are there are more for example the establishing shots and
establishing shots

202
00:17:56,528 --> 00:18:02,928
I think you can really recognize it if you're watching a movie and most of the
time the

203
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:11,328
the opening shot of the the movie is for example we're seeing and the movie
starts

204
00:18:12,048 --> 00:18:19,808
and we're seeing New York so all these buildings with the sun and then we're
going to the

205
00:18:21,888 --> 00:18:31,167
to one flat building like this here and then we're going to the maybe we're
seeing one

206
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:36,928
window in this flat building with this character like this here.

207
00:18:37,904 --> 00:18:45,583
So these are all establishing shots and it helps you as the viewer understand
where we are in this

208
00:18:45,586 --> 00:18:53,183
world and then you go closer because it gives you this sense that you you know
where everything is

209
00:18:53,186 --> 00:19:00,464
and so on. So when our two persons are talking in a shot oftentimes it's called
the two shots

210
00:19:01,664 --> 00:19:06,463
and later I will tell a bit more about that but you also have three shots or
four shots

211
00:19:06,466 --> 00:19:13,024
or five shots. A three shot is when there are three characters in a shot, four
is when four and etc.

212
00:19:15,504 --> 00:19:19,263
You also have these camera shots like an over the shoulder.

213
00:19:19,266 --> 00:19:22,864
So we're looking over the shoulder to the other person.

214
00:19:24,704 --> 00:19:30,384
There's this bird view that's often used in establishing shots and it's called
bird view

215
00:19:31,344 --> 00:19:32,224
because we

216
00:19:35,104 --> 00:19:37,104
it's like we have this bird here.

217
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,559
And this bird is looking at this person.

218
00:19:40,562 --> 00:19:42,119
We also have a frog view.

219
00:19:42,122 --> 00:19:45,479
For example, if a frog is here

220
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:47,759
and we have this person here,

221
00:19:47,762 --> 00:19:49,639
this frog looks up

222
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:53,479
and then the shot will look a bit like this.

223
00:19:53,482 --> 00:19:56,300
So when this person,

224
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,359
so this is looking like this,

225
00:20:02,362 --> 00:20:03,679
it's looking really big.

226
00:20:03,682 --> 00:20:06,360
So we're feeling really tiny and small.

227
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,960
So you have this bird view.

228
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,239
Point of view, for example,

229
00:20:13,242 --> 00:20:17,759
if you are looking through glasses

230
00:20:17,762 --> 00:20:21,279
or you're looking through the bushes or something,

231
00:20:21,282 --> 00:20:24,120
or when you're looking through a car trunk,

232
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,559
that's called a POV, point of view.

233
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:32,359
So some shows or movies are using that a lot

234
00:20:32,362 --> 00:20:34,519
in creative ways.

235
00:20:34,522 --> 00:20:35,568
The Dutch angle.

236
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:39,008
And I'm Dutch, but I don't know why it's called Dutch.

237
00:20:39,048 --> 00:20:44,088
I think it's even originally from Germany, but, uh, that's meant when.

238
00:20:44,568 --> 00:20:49,488
The, the horizon line is, uh, at an angle.

239
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:55,368
So, and that can help give you this weird, strange feeling.

240
00:20:55,888 --> 00:21:01,527
And it's, it's put you literally off balance this, uh, a lot of times used

241
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:07,648
in action scenes or horror scenes, or when a person gets sick or something.

242
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:12,208
Um, um, that's used with the Dutch angle.

243
00:21:13,448 --> 00:21:21,728
So, um, here I'm showing a bit more about it, uh, bird and frog perspective.

244
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:29,727
So we have the camera, the eye line and the object like this person.

245
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:34,968
So this eye line is the line that comes out of the.

246
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:42,416
the camera. When we are looking and we're looking in front of us we have this
eye line.

247
00:21:43,056 --> 00:21:50,495
So this horizon line is at the same line as our eye line. I'm talking a bit more
about

248
00:21:50,498 --> 00:21:58,895
this in the perspective facebook. The base thing is that this eye line
determines the perspective

249
00:21:58,898 --> 00:22:07,535
of the character. For example if we have the camera and this camera is looking
up this eye

250
00:22:07,538 --> 00:22:16,735
line goes up like this and it means that here it was we were at the same height
but here we're

251
00:22:16,738 --> 00:22:25,295
smaller so we're looking up at this person. Now and this is this frog
perspective it's like there's

252
00:22:25,298 --> 00:22:34,736
a frog here looking upwards and here this is the birth view but this you can
also call this

253
00:22:35,168 --> 00:22:45,248
frog view the low angle or this birth view and high angle and this can be used
to create for example

254
00:22:47,168 --> 00:22:56,128
here we're a frog so we're weak but here we're bigger so maybe here we're a
super big monster

255
00:22:56,848 --> 00:23:01,488
like in here so now the camera is really strong and this person is

256
00:23:02,288 --> 00:23:09,648
this person is weak and we are strong and in this case this character is strong

257
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:12,848
and we're weak

258
00:23:16,848 --> 00:23:18,848
so camera angles and more

259
00:23:21,408 --> 00:23:29,247
so this doesn't tell us anything and there are movie directors who are using a
lot of these shots

260
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,608
and that gives them this own style

261
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:38,263
But they are basically breaking the rules, but then you really need to know what
you

262
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:41,623
are doing and it's really difficult to do that good.

263
00:23:41,626 --> 00:23:50,883
So if we want to have this cat and mouse scene making it look really dangerous,
we make this

264
00:23:50,886 --> 00:23:55,703
cat big and this mouse small.

265
00:23:55,706 --> 00:24:03,863
So if we're looking here, so here, if this was the movie set here, we have the
camera

266
00:24:03,866 --> 00:24:10,903
was looking down because here's this cat and here's this mouse.

267
00:24:10,906 --> 00:24:15,583
So the cat is close to the camera and you can try this out with your phone or
your own

268
00:24:15,586 --> 00:24:16,823
camera.

269
00:24:16,826 --> 00:24:18,783
So the cat is close to the camera.

270
00:24:18,786 --> 00:24:21,423
So the cat appears bigger than it is.

271
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:26,663
And the mouse is farther away from the camera and then that makes this mouse
smaller.

272
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:29,663
For example, we can also turn it around.

273
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:32,543
Here we have this cat.

274
00:24:32,546 --> 00:24:35,624
Mouse, and we put the camera here.

275
00:24:38,424 --> 00:24:44,423
Then we have, so if we would draw that here, then we have this mouse

276
00:24:44,426 --> 00:24:46,424
isn't really big and it's cat.

277
00:24:47,864 --> 00:24:48,664
It's small.

278
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:52,824
So this could also actually work.

279
00:24:53,864 --> 00:24:57,624
So try to, um, but then, yeah, it's different.

280
00:24:57,704 --> 00:25:01,984
You can see that's because the mouse is closer to the camera, et cetera.

281
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:10,104
Um, yeah, here I'm telling this about this, uh, low angle.

282
00:25:10,424 --> 00:25:14,263
So here we have this character.

283
00:25:14,266 --> 00:25:22,384
So basically this is a bit like, uh, the camera is looking a bit.

284
00:25:24,464 --> 00:25:26,304
Nope, not much.

285
00:25:27,504 --> 00:25:29,504
And here we have this.

286
00:25:30,416 --> 00:25:37,136
person, but this person is way bigger and stands here. So you get this, this
kind of shot.

287
00:25:38,576 --> 00:25:44,975
And we're using this low, here, this camera is really low. And it makes this
monster really

288
00:25:44,978 --> 00:25:55,216
big. It really goes over the person. So weak, strong, try to think in those
terms.

289
00:25:55,936 --> 00:26:02,736
So here I'm using this Dutch angle and it makes it really dynamic and actionful
by

290
00:26:03,616 --> 00:26:11,216
using this angle in this shot. So lenses, here you can see all the different
lenses.

291
00:26:14,096 --> 00:26:20,255
So we're drawing, but still we can think about what kind of lenses do we want to
use?

292
00:26:20,258 --> 00:26:26,336
So camera has a lens and maybe you have that on your, on your phone.

293
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:37,379
So a wide angle lens and that means for example if we're looking at this camera

294
00:26:37,382 --> 00:26:44,759
and a wide angle lens means basically we get this really wide view, so like
this.

295
00:26:44,762 --> 00:26:52,760
So when we're looking at this house here and a lot of times it means that the

296
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,959
camera is close to the object.

297
00:26:55,962 --> 00:27:06,519
This object looks really big, but you also get this distorted look because of
the perspective.

298
00:27:06,522 --> 00:27:13,919
Here you can see here you get this, even this three point perspective.

299
00:27:13,922 --> 00:27:17,099
You can see this really strong perspective, right?

300
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:22,379
And that's because of this, that the camera is close and it's a wide angle shot.

301
00:27:22,382 --> 00:27:27,440
So our eyes is a bit...

302
00:27:28,752 --> 00:27:34,671
So this is the size of the lens, so 40 to 60 millimeter.

303
00:27:34,674 --> 00:27:37,952
And you can compare that to our eyes.

304
00:27:38,832 --> 00:27:44,831
So that means we are at medium range and we're looking at this house.

305
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:46,352
Maybe it's a bit further away.

306
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:51,151
So something like this.

307
00:27:51,154 --> 00:27:54,512
But you can see this is wider than this is.

308
00:27:55,152 --> 00:28:01,072
So telescope lens, and maybe you've watched through a telescope or bionicles

309
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,752
is when the camera is really far away.

310
00:28:05,632 --> 00:28:06,592
And here's the house.

311
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:15,311
But the lens is very small or narrow and you get this.

312
00:28:15,314 --> 00:28:18,111
So that makes, there's almost no perspective.

313
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,312
And it's really weird.

314
00:28:19,952 --> 00:28:21,951
Try to, maybe you have that.

315
00:28:21,954 --> 00:28:25,712
Maybe you have your bionicles,

316
00:28:26,064 --> 00:28:33,823
or telescope, or maybe once you're in the city, or when you're at a tourist
location,

317
00:28:33,826 --> 00:28:38,383
you often have these kind of telescopes. And when you're watching through it,

318
00:28:38,386 --> 00:28:50,463
you almost see no perspective. And also, here, this grass in the foreground is
really out of

319
00:28:50,466 --> 00:28:59,024
focus. But that's a bit of a different thing. But you can really use this for
different

320
00:29:01,504 --> 00:29:10,863
goals. For example, here, I'm showing that in a lot of skate videos. I grew up
in the 90s,

321
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:22,144
and we always had, everywhere you saw these music clips, or skateboarders, and
they used this

322
00:29:22,448 --> 00:29:28,367
really extreme close-up, and you really get this distorted view, where this part
looks really big,

323
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:39,807
and this small, and so on. So here, the 40, 60 millimeter, this is the camera
you want to use

324
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:48,367
most, because that feels, this feels normal, because this lens is like our eyes.
So in a

325
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:54,127
movie, if you want to see, let something look plain and normal, you use this. If
you want to make

326
00:29:54,130 --> 00:30:00,847
something look special, you use this, or you use this. And this effect, and here
you can see it,

327
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:11,967
there's no perspective. Yeah, this, so this lens is used for when we're looking
from someone from a

328
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:20,688
great distance. Camera movement. So when we're in, when we're making
storyboards,

329
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:26,552
we need to use different camera movements.

330
00:30:28,832 --> 00:30:33,831
Actually here, it's not really a camera movement,

331
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:34,991
it's a zoom in.

332
00:30:34,994 --> 00:30:37,831
So the camera stays at the same position,

333
00:30:37,834 --> 00:30:42,751
but the lens is going different,

334
00:30:42,754 --> 00:30:44,991
and we're zooming in because of that.

335
00:30:44,994 --> 00:30:46,751
So this is called the zoom in.

336
00:30:46,754 --> 00:30:51,071
And in storyboarding, you're using these kind of arrows

337
00:30:51,074 --> 00:30:53,112
to show that.

338
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:58,031
We also have a pan, and that means when the camera,

339
00:30:58,034 --> 00:31:00,271
so we're starting here with the camera,

340
00:31:00,274 --> 00:31:03,831
and then we're going move to the side to here.

341
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:05,711
So for example, it's like this.

342
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:10,712
So here, and then we're panning to the right to this shot.

343
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:12,712
And this is called a pan.

344
00:31:14,552 --> 00:31:16,671
We also have a tilt.

345
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:20,351
And for example, we're starting here,

346
00:31:20,354 --> 00:31:21,512
and we're going up.

347
00:31:22,784 --> 00:31:25,023
and you can use these kind of arrows.

348
00:31:25,026 --> 00:31:26,704
You can also draw them like this.

349
00:31:27,664 --> 00:31:30,383
I think it's better to even draw them like this,

350
00:31:30,386 --> 00:31:33,904
because here the shot moves up to this.

351
00:31:35,104 --> 00:31:36,464
But that's called the tilt.

352
00:31:37,904 --> 00:31:39,664
Oh yeah, one thing for the zoom in,

353
00:31:40,304 --> 00:31:43,343
in when you're making a real movie,

354
00:31:43,346 --> 00:31:45,103
you can also, besides the zoom in,

355
00:31:45,106 --> 00:31:46,704
you can also put the camera,

356
00:31:47,504 --> 00:31:50,304
move the camera closer to the person.

357
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:54,143
And this is called, I think out of my head, trunking.

358
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:59,184
So here we're moving the camera closer to the person we're filming.

359
00:32:03,104 --> 00:32:04,704
Camera movements with pens.

360
00:32:05,504 --> 00:32:08,463
Here we, this is the pen I just showed,

361
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:09,743
for horizontal pen.

362
00:32:09,746 --> 00:32:12,303
And you can use this for this action scene.

363
00:32:12,306 --> 00:32:13,983
So sometimes in storyboarding,

364
00:32:13,986 --> 00:32:17,423
you can use these arrows to show the car is moving.

365
00:32:17,426 --> 00:32:19,664
Vertical pen.

366
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:23,712
So yeah, just what I've shown earlier.

367
00:32:24,992 --> 00:32:29,151
Or you can also use a diagonal pen.

368
00:32:29,154 --> 00:32:32,191
So that means when we have this and for example,

369
00:32:32,194 --> 00:32:36,272
this can be really useful when we're going from down from a hill.

370
00:32:37,792 --> 00:32:41,391
And we follow this person so that would move here.

371
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:42,432
So like this here.

372
00:32:43,792 --> 00:32:50,112
And this arrow means basically that we follow this person like this.

373
00:32:51,232 --> 00:32:58,191
So here are some more.

374
00:32:58,194 --> 00:33:00,431
So this is like the zooming.

375
00:33:00,434 --> 00:33:05,072
You can call it the truck in or a truck out, zoom out.

376
00:33:08,752 --> 00:33:10,991
Clockwise rotation truck in.

377
00:33:10,994 --> 00:33:14,272
So this is basically the same as this one.

378
00:33:14,832 --> 00:33:17,231
But then the camera rotates.

379
00:33:17,234 --> 00:33:18,351
Maybe I can.

380
00:33:18,354 --> 00:33:20,783
So what basically is happening.

381
00:33:20,786 --> 00:33:25,784
We're going, zooming in, but also the camera rotates, right?

382
00:33:27,344 --> 00:33:30,263
So here you can see I'm rotating the camera.

383
00:33:30,266 --> 00:33:35,264
So that's what's happening there.

384
00:33:35,664 --> 00:33:37,343
Here, it's a little bit different.

385
00:33:37,346 --> 00:33:39,624
Here, we're starting here.

386
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:45,424
So we're starting here and then we zoom out or check out.

387
00:33:47,304 --> 00:33:49,303
And we're going back to this.

388
00:33:49,306 --> 00:33:52,583
So this is a counter-clockwise rotation check out.

389
00:33:52,586 --> 00:33:56,823
And this means, this is to clarify

390
00:33:56,826 --> 00:34:00,663
which way it rotates to.

391
00:34:00,666 --> 00:34:03,983
But here you can see the movements of the camera,

392
00:34:03,986 --> 00:34:06,744
of the panel by these arrows.

393
00:34:08,104 --> 00:34:10,223
You can also use this tracking a bit.

394
00:34:10,226 --> 00:34:13,163
For example, here we're seeing all these people

395
00:34:13,166 --> 00:34:14,703
and they are saying, what is that?

396
00:34:14,706 --> 00:34:15,964
Is it a plane?

397
00:34:16,824 --> 00:34:18,423
Is it an UFO?

398
00:34:18,426 --> 00:34:20,064
No, it's Superman.

399
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:28,384
And then they're zooming in with this, with this truck, truck in.

400
00:34:30,304 --> 00:34:34,383
So this is a little bit different, but that's also interesting.

401
00:34:34,386 --> 00:34:37,504
For, for example, when there's an earthquake, everything shakes.

402
00:34:38,864 --> 00:34:44,784
And you can use these symbols on your panels to clarify that, that shaking.

403
00:34:44,944 --> 00:34:50,144
So blur, and I talked a bit, a little bit about that with the different lenses.

404
00:34:54,144 --> 00:34:58,064
Um, so, and it can really help with creating depth.

405
00:34:58,624 --> 00:35:08,943
For example, here we have this palm tree and it feels close to us or, um, it, it
gives this

406
00:35:08,946 --> 00:35:19,984
effect of, uh, framing, but here we have this character that's really, um, on
focus.

407
00:35:20,064 --> 00:35:26,503
And because of that, uh, our, I really focus on that person, the same here.

408
00:35:26,506 --> 00:35:30,343
The background is out of focus and this person's in focus.

409
00:35:30,346 --> 00:35:33,784
So that helps us read what we're trying to tell.

410
00:35:35,304 --> 00:35:36,584
A rack focus.

411
00:35:36,624 --> 00:35:43,864
So this means basically we're starting with what's basically happening.

412
00:35:44,224 --> 00:35:45,624
I can draw it out here.

413
00:35:46,784 --> 00:35:49,104
Oh, yeah, I already drew it.

414
00:35:49,584 --> 00:35:57,103
So this shot starts with, he is in focus and then the next shot, this is in
focus.

415
00:35:57,106 --> 00:36:02,424
And there's this kind of transition between those, um, those shots.

416
00:36:05,184 --> 00:36:06,463
Uh, animated backgrounds.

417
00:36:06,466 --> 00:36:16,863
So I talked a bit about this with the, uh, the pen shots, but here I use these
arrows

418
00:36:16,866 --> 00:36:19,384
to show that's the background.

419
00:36:19,904 --> 00:36:23,504
is moving behind this, uh, this character.

420
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:29,823
So there's this moving backgrounds, but the, the person stays on the same place.

421
00:36:29,826 --> 00:36:34,224
So that's different with the pen, but with these arrows, I'm trying to, to show
that,

422
00:36:34,784 --> 00:36:39,744
uh, moving backgrounds. You can also use it. For example, when you're riding in
this, uh, on this,

423
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:46,624
on this road, the car stays on the same position, but the background, uh,
changes.

424
00:36:47,424 --> 00:36:55,663
Maybe, uh, the road goes that way. Um, so for example, that means that you have
maybe a road

425
00:36:55,666 --> 00:37:01,184
like this, but then the here, if this is the car, then here is the camera.

426
00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:12,303
The camera follows the car. And that means the background is moving and the car
is not,

427
00:37:12,306 --> 00:37:16,624
um, you can also use this.

428
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:22,208
I think, oh, is this also a parallax? Parallaxing?

429
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:29,567
Um, I don't know the term, but that's used in, uh, in gaming and in 2D games,

430
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:34,447
where we have all these different objects, uh, oh, parallax effect.

431
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:40,528
So that these objects, so this tree is in the foreground and these mountains in
the background.

432
00:37:41,168 --> 00:37:47,407
So these mountains are farther away and they, this is basically a pen.

433
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:51,328
So we're following this character and walking on this path.

434
00:37:53,328 --> 00:38:00,687
But if we're doing that, you can move the tree to the left quite fast.

435
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:06,767
But these mountains also move a bit and it has to do with the perspective.

436
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:10,768
So for example, here, the camera is moving.

437
00:38:12,928 --> 00:38:17,168
And here we have the tree and we're following this person walking, right?

438
00:38:18,384 --> 00:38:23,904
So the camera moves along with the person that is walking to this side.

439
00:38:24,544 --> 00:38:28,384
Then we also have here all these mountains but those are really,

440
00:38:33,024 --> 00:38:40,863
really far away. So these are here are all these mountains and here's all the
tree and

441
00:38:40,866 --> 00:38:46,943
but here remember those lenses are like this. So these mountains are really far
away so that

442
00:38:46,946 --> 00:38:53,664
means that they are moving slower and that the things in the foreground move
faster.

443
00:38:54,704 --> 00:39:00,624
Maybe it's a bit hard to tell but try to, especially in 2D animations,

444
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:07,824
once you see a shot like this, try to see the different layers of the

445
00:39:09,424 --> 00:39:11,263
backgrounds and how fast they are moving.

446
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:13,024
So

447
00:39:16,096 --> 00:39:23,935
When we're going to make storyboards, there are some camera rules we need to
use.

448
00:39:23,938 --> 00:39:30,896
For example, the 180 camera rule. So when we're filming,

449
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:34,815
for example, we have two characters talking to each other.

450
00:39:34,818 --> 00:39:46,096
Um, so maybe one shot filming here and then another shot for filming here and
then here,

451
00:39:46,816 --> 00:39:58,015
then it's really hard to follow who is who. There's this trick for, and that's
the 180 rule.

452
00:39:58,018 --> 00:40:05,616
So that means that if we have two persons, we draw this imaginary line between
those persons

453
00:40:07,376 --> 00:40:13,696
and we're putting the cameras only on this side of the

454
00:40:15,984 --> 00:40:24,064
of this border. So this helps

455
00:40:26,464 --> 00:40:34,784
see where we're looking at. Because if you're going over this border then it
makes it harder

456
00:40:36,624 --> 00:40:41,664
to follow what are we looking at. So for example here I'm using these shots.

457
00:40:42,464 --> 00:40:49,584
So this is camera one. So here we're seeing this person is left and this person
is right.

458
00:40:50,624 --> 00:40:57,823
In shot two this person is also on the left and this person is on the right. In
three this person

459
00:40:57,826 --> 00:41:05,023
is also on the left and on the right. So that makes it really simple to follow.
But if we're

460
00:41:05,026 --> 00:41:13,984
to watch it from this view then the person with the hat is on the left and then
this

461
00:41:14,192 --> 00:41:23,391
person is on the right and that makes it confusing so normally you don't use
that

462
00:41:23,394 --> 00:41:28,352
camera on the other side you can maybe if you're watching an

463
00:41:30,672 --> 00:41:35,871
tiffy where they're interviewing people on the table they're also often using
this

464
00:41:35,874 --> 00:41:43,872
and you can cross the border but then you need to show clearly for example it's
an establishing shot

465
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:54,271
what is happening or when you're using an orbit camera so in this case we have
this camera here

466
00:41:54,274 --> 00:42:01,471
looking at here but then it moves all the way around and so there's this famous
2000 action

467
00:42:01,474 --> 00:42:10,591
movie that's also using this but then this called 360 orbit camera when the
camera is moving around

468
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:11,824
that's the character

469
00:42:12,064 --> 00:42:15,904
so rotating with the camera around the subject

470
00:42:18,224 --> 00:42:25,504
it's used for action shots it's not often used but it's this cool effect I
wanted to share

471
00:42:27,744 --> 00:42:37,983
so rotation of the camera so this is a bit like a pen but if we're just moving
it like

472
00:42:37,986 --> 00:42:44,943
straight plane like this it's kind of boring so it's more interesting if we're
using this

473
00:42:44,946 --> 00:42:52,944
perspective like this and then we're seeing that so if this person was a box

474
00:42:53,744 --> 00:43:02,063
first we're seeing this perspective the f from front and then we're seeing the
back of the person

475
00:43:02,066 --> 00:43:11,104
like this and then we're even seeing more of the back

476
00:43:11,344 --> 00:43:18,943
of the person so like this so that makes it a bit more easy easier to understand
so this

477
00:43:18,946 --> 00:43:25,584
also a pen but then the camera is rotating and it helps me giving this
interesting shots

478
00:43:27,584 --> 00:43:36,063
um a really good way to get better at storyboarding is to

479
00:43:36,066 --> 00:43:45,423
analyze movies so go watch a movie and try to recognize the shots on now we're
seeing

480
00:43:45,426 --> 00:43:53,504
establishing shots and now it's a long shot and now we're looking at medium
shots and a close-up

481
00:43:54,064 --> 00:44:01,024
an extreme close-up an extreme closure close-up so they're really building up so
it's really like

482
00:44:01,664 --> 00:44:09,343
and here here's the action in the character and we're starting with establishing
shots the medium

483
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:09,999
shots

484
00:44:10,002 --> 00:44:17,119
and then the close shot so we're building up this tension and it's also easy to
feel for the

485
00:44:17,122 --> 00:44:24,559
character so oh we are in the desert and i see two oh no no the establishing
shots we're starting the

486
00:44:24,562 --> 00:44:33,280
movie we're seeing a desert oh in the desert are two characters standing in
front of each other

487
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:42,000
oh they have a gun and they're looking mean oh i can see the tension in the eyes
i can see the gun

488
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,800
and you see his reaction oh he's going to draw the gun so that you're telling a
story with these

489
00:44:49,520 --> 00:45:00,239
kinds of shots and again a great way to learn this is to go watch a movie take
your sketchbook

490
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:09,200
and make quick scribbles of what you can see maybe you can freeze the movie to
to analyze the shot better

491
00:45:10,272 --> 00:45:13,711
This is really a great way of learning storyboarding.

492
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:17,311
Go watch a movie and sketch these shots

493
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:20,791
and try to think of what does director wants to tell

494
00:45:20,794 --> 00:45:22,112
with this kind of shots.
